b'Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 As you know, I just met with leaders of both parties to discuss a way forward in light of the severe budget cuts that start to take effect today.\xc2\xa0 I told them these cuts will hurt our economy.\xc2\xa0 They will cost us jobs.\xc2\xa0 And to set it right, both sides need to be willing to compromise. The good news is the American people are strong and they\xe2\x80\x99re resilient.\xc2\xa0 They fought hard to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and we will get through this as well.\xc2\xa0 Even with these cuts in place, folks all across this country will work hard to make sure that we keep the recovery going.\xc2\xa0 But Washington sure isn\xe2\x80\x99t making it easy.\xc2\xa0 At a time when our businesses have finally begun to get some traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to America -- we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be making a series of dumb, arbitrary cuts to things that businesses depend on and workers depend on, like education, and research, and infrastructure and defense.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 And at a time when too many Americans are still looking for work, it\xe2\x80\x99s inexcusable. Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away.\xc2\xa0 The pain, though, will be real.\xc2\xa0 Beginning this week, many middle-class families will have their lives disrupted in significant ways.\xc2\xa0 Businesses that work with the military, like the Virginia shipbuilder that I visited on Tuesday, may have to lay folks off.\xc2\xa0 Communities near military bases will take a serious blow.\xc2\xa0 Hundreds of thousands of Americans who serve their country -- Border Patrol agents, FBI agents, civilians who work at the Pentagon -- all will suffer significant pay cuts and furloughs.\xc2\xa0 All of this will cause a ripple effect throughout our economy.\xc2\xa0 Layoffs and pay cuts means that people have less money in their pockets, and that means that they have less money to spend at local businesses.\xc2\xa0 That means lower profits.\xc2\xa0 That means fewer hires.\xc2\xa0 The longer these cuts remain in place, the greater the damage to our economy -- a slow grind that will intensify with each passing day.\xc2\xa0 So economists are estimating that as a consequence of this sequester, that we could see growth cut by over one-half of 1 percent.\xc2\xa0 It will cost about 750,000 jobs at a time when we should be growing jobs more quickly.\xc2\xa0 So every time that we get a piece of economic news, over the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as the sequester is in place, we\xe2\x80\x99ll know that that economic news could have been better if Congress had not failed to act.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 None of this is necessary.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s happening because of a choice that Republicans in Congress have made.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful loophole to help reduce the deficit.\xc2\xa0 As recently as yesterday, they decided to protect special interest tax breaks for the well-off and well-connected, and they think that that\xe2\x80\x99s apparently more important than protecting our military or middle-class families from the pain of these cuts.\xc2\xa0 I do believe that we can and must replace these cuts with a more balanced approach that asks something from everybody:\xc2\xa0 Smart spending cuts; entitlement reform; tax reform that makes the tax code more fair for families and businesses without raising tax rates --\xc2\xa0 all so that we can responsibly lower the deficit without laying off workers, or forcing parents to scramble for childcare, or slashing financial aid for college students. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s too much to ask.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is partisan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of approach that I\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed for two years.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what I ran on last year.\xc2\xa0 And the majority of the American people agree with me in this approach, including, by the way, a majority of Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We just need Republicans in Congress to catch up with their own party and their country on this.\xc2\xa0 And if they did so, we could make a lot of progress. I do know that there are Republicans in Congress who privately, at least, say that they would rather close tax loopholes than let these cuts go through.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are Democrats who\xe2\x80\x99d rather do smart entitlement reform than let these cuts go through.\xc2\xa0 So there is a caucus of common sense up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a silent group right now, and we want to make sure that their voices start getting heard. In the coming days and in the coming weeks I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep on reaching out to them, both individually and as groups of senators or members of the House, and say to them, let\xe2\x80\x99s fix this -- not just for a month or two, but for years to come.\xc2\xa0 Because the greatest nation on Earth does not conduct its business in month-to-month increments, or by careening from crisis to crisis.\xc2\xa0 And America has got a lot more work to do. In the meantime, we can\xe2\x80\x99t let political gridlock around the budget stand in the way of other areas where we can make progress.\xc2\xa0 I was pleased to see that the House passed the Violence Against Women Act yesterday.\xc2\xa0 That is a big win for not just women but for families and for the American people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a law that\xe2\x80\x99s going to save lives and help more Americans live free from fear.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pushing on for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I was glad to see that done.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an example of how we can still get some important bipartisan legislation through this Congress even though there is still these fiscal arguments taking place.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are other areas where we can make progress even with the sequester unresolved.\xc2\xa0 I will continue to push for those initiatives.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep pushing for high-quality preschool for every family that wants it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep pushing to make sure that we raise the minimum wage so that it\xe2\x80\x99s one that families can live on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep on pushing for immigration reform, and reform our voting system, and improvements on our transportation sector.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep pushing for sensible gun reforms because I still think they deserve a vote. This is the agenda that the American people voted for.\xc2\xa0 These are America\xe2\x80\x99s priorities.\xc2\xa0 They are too important to go\xc2\xa0 unaddressed.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep pushing to make sure that we see them through.\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take some questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start with Julie. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 How much responsibility do you feel like you bear for these cuts taking effect?\xc2\xa0 And is the only way to offset them at this point for Republicans to bend on revenue, or do you see any alternatives? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'ve already cut $2.5 trillion in our deficit.\xc2\xa0 Everybody says we need to cut $4 trillion, which means we have to come up with another trillion and a half.\xc2\xa0 The vast majority of economists agree that the problem when it comes to deficits is not discretionary spending.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not that we\'re spending too much money on education.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not that we\'re spending too much money on job training, or that we\'re spending too much money rebuilding our roads and our bridges.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not.\xc2\xa0 The problem that we have is a long-term problem in terms of our health care costs and programs like Medicare.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'ve said very specifically, very detailed is that I\'m prepared to take on the problem where it exists -- on entitlements -- and do some things that my own party really doesn\'t like -- if it\'s part of a broader package of sensible deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 So the deal that I\'ve put forward over the last two years, the deal that I put forward as recently as December is still on the table.\xc2\xa0 I am prepared to do hard things and to push my Democratic friends to do hard things. But what I can\'t do is ask middle-class families, ask seniors, ask students to bear the entire burden of deficit reduction when we know we\'ve got a bunch of tax loopholes that are benefiting the well-off and the well-connected, aren\'t contributing to growth, aren\'t contributing to our economy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not fair.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not right.\xc2\xa0 The American people don\'t think it\'s fair and don\'t think it\'s right. So I recognize that Speaker Boehner has got challenges in his caucus.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that it\'s very hard for Republican leaders to be perceived as making concessions to me.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, I reflect is there something else I could do to make these guys -- I\'m not talking about the leaders now, but maybe some of the House Republican caucus members -- not paint horns on my head.\xc2\xa0 And I genuinely believe that there\'s an opportunity for us to cooperate.\xc2\xa0 But what doesn\'t make sense -- and the only thing that we\'ve seen from Republicans so far in terms of proposals -- is to replace this set of arbitrary cuts with even worse arbitrary cuts.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to help the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to help growth.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And as a number of economists have noted, ironically, it doesn\'t even reduce our deficit in the smartest way possible or the fastest way possible.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of going forward, my hope is that after some reflection -- as members of Congress start hearing from constituents who are being negatively impacted, as we start seeing the impact that the sequester is having -- that they step back and say, all right, is there a way for us to move forward on a package of entitlement reforms, tax reform, not raising tax rates, identifying programs that don\'t work, coming up with a plan that\'s comprehensive and that makes sense.\xc2\xa0 And it may take a couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 It may take a couple of months, but I\'m just going to keep on pushing on it.\xc2\xa0 And my view is that, ultimately, common sense prevails.\xc2\xa0 But what is true right now is that the Republicans have made a choice that maintaining an ironclad rule that we will not accept an extra dime\xe2\x80\x99s worth of revenue makes it very difficult for us to get any larger comprehensive deal.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a choice they\'re making.\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying that it\'s more important to preserve these tax loopholes than it is to prevent these arbitrary cuts.\xc2\xa0 And what\'s interesting is Speaker Boehner, just a couple months ago, identified these tax loopholes and tax breaks and said we should close them and raise revenue.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not as if it\'s not possible to do.\xc2\xa0 They themselves have suggested that it\'s possible to do.\xc2\xa0 And if they believe that in fact these tax loopholes and these tax breaks for the well-off and the well-connected aren\xe2\x80\x99t contributing to growth, aren\'t good for our economy, aren\'t particularly fair and can raise revenue, well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we get started?\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do that? It may be that because of the politics within the Republican Party, they can\'t do it right now.\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 My hope is, is that they can do it later.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to repeat, Julie, because I think it\'s very important to understand, it\'s not as if Democrats aren\'t being asked to do anything, either, to compromise.\xc2\xa0 There are members of my party who violently disagree with the notion that we should do anything on Medicare.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m willing to say to them, I disagree with you, because I want to preserve Medicare for the long haul.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to have some tough politics within my party to get this done.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not a situation where I\'m only asking for concessions from Republicans and asking nothing from Democrats.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that everybody is going to have to do something.\xc2\xa0 And the one key to this whole thing is trying to make sure we keep in mind who we\'re here for.\xc2\xa0 We are not here for ourselves, we\'re not here for our parties, we\'re not here to advance our electoral prospects.\xc2\xa0 We\'re here for American families who have been getting battered pretty good over the last four years, are just starting to see the economy improve; businesses are just starting to see some confidence coming back.\xc2\xa0 And this is not a win for anybody, this is a loss for the American people. And, again, if we step back and just remind ourselves what it is we\'re supposed to be doing here, then hopefully common sense will out in the end. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\'re saying that this is a Republican problem and not one that you bear any responsibility for. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, give me an example of what I might do. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to clarify your statement. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, but I\'m trying to clarify the question.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m suggesting is, I\'ve put forward a plan that calls for serious spending cuts, serious entitlement reforms, goes right at the problem that is at the heart of our long-term deficit problem.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve offered negotiations around that kind of balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 And so far, we\'ve gotten rebuffed because what Speaker Boehner and the Republicans have said is, we cannot do any revenue, we can\'t do a dime\'s worth of revenue. So what more do you think I should do?\xc2\xa0 Okay, I just wanted to clarify.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Because if people have a suggestion, I\'m happy to -- this is a room full of smart folks. All right -- Zach Goldfarb. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, the next focal point seems to be the continuing resolution that\xe2\x80\x99s funding the government at the end of the month, that expires at the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 Would you sign a CR that continues the sequester but continues to fund the government?\xc2\xa0 And in a related point, how do you truly reach the limits of your persuasive power?\xc2\xa0 Is there any other leverage you have to convince the Republicans, to convince folks that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the way to go? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think I\xe2\x80\x99ve still got some persuasive power left.\xc2\xa0 Let me check.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, the issue is not my persuasive power.\xc2\xa0 The American people agree with my approach.\xc2\xa0 They agree that we should have a balanced approach to deficit reduction. The question is can the American people help persuade their members of Congress to do the right thing, and I have a lot of confidence that over time, if the American people express their displeasure about how something is working, that eventually Congress responds.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes there is a little gap between what the American people think and what Congress thinks.\xc2\xa0 But eventually Congress catches up. With respect to the budget and keeping the government open -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll try for our viewing audience to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking in Washington gobbledygook.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s called the continuing resolution, which is essentially just an extension of last year\xe2\x80\x99s budget into this year\xe2\x80\x99s budget to make sure that basic government functions continue, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do to make sure that we don\'t have a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s preventable. We have a Budget Control Act, right?\xc2\xa0 We agreed to a certain amount of money that was going to be spent each year, and certain funding levels for our military, our education system, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 If we stick to that deal, then I will be supportive of us sticking to that deal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a deal that I made.\xc2\xa0 The sequester are additional cuts on top of that.\xc2\xa0 And by law, until Congress takes the sequester away, we\xe2\x80\x99d have to abide by those additional cuts.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why we should have another crisis by shutting the government down in addition to these arbitrary spending cuts. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to make it 100 percent clear, you\xe2\x80\x99d sign a budget that continues to fund the government even at the lower levels of the sequester, even if you don\'t prefer to do that? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Zach, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I never want to make myself 100 percent clear with you guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that I made a deal for a certain budget, certain numbers.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why that deal needs to be reopened.\xc2\xa0 It was a deal that Speaker Boehner made as well, and all the leadership made.\xc2\xa0 And if the bill that arrives on my desk is reflective of the commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously made, then obviously I would sign it because I want to make sure that we keep on doing what we need to do for the American people. Jessica. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, to your question, what could you do -- first of all, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you just have them down here and refuse to let them leave the room until you have a deal?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I mean, Jessica, I am not a dictator.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m the President.\xc2\xa0 So, ultimately, if Mitch McConnell or John Boehner say, we need to go to catch a plane, I can\'t have Secret Service block the doorway, right?\xc2\xa0 So --\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that part of leadership?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to interrupt, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t --\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 And I know that this has been some of the conventional wisdom that\'s been floating around Washington that somehow, even though most people agree that I\xe2\x80\x99m being reasonable, that most people agree I\xe2\x80\x99m presenting a fair deal, the fact that they don\'t take it means that I should somehow do a Jedi mind-meld with these folks and convince them to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 Well, they\'re elected.\xc2\xa0 We have a constitutional system of government.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker of the House and the leader of the Senate and all those folks have responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 What I can do is I can make the best possible case for why we need to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 I can speak to the American people about the consequences of the decisions that Congress is making or the lack of decision-making by Congress.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s a choice they make. And this idea that somehow there\xe2\x80\x99s a secret formula or secret sauce to get Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell to say, you know what, Mr. President, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, we should close some tax loopholes for the well-off and well-connected in exchange for some serious entitlement reform and spending cuts of programs we don\'t need.\xc2\xa0 I think if there was a secret way to do that, I would have tried it.\xc2\xa0 I would have done it.\xc2\xa0 What I can do is I can make the best possible argument.\xc2\xa0 And I can offer concessions, and I can offer compromise.\xc2\xa0 I can negotiate.\xc2\xa0 I can make sure that my party is willing to compromise and is not being ideological or thinking about these just in terms of political terms.\xc2\xa0 And I think I\'ve done that and I will continue to do that. But what I can\'t do is force Congress to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 The American people may have the capacity to do that.\xc2\xa0 And in the absence of a decision on the part of the Speaker of the House and others to put middle-class families ahead of whatever political imperatives he might have right now, we\'re going to have these cuts in place.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I\'m hopeful about human nature.\xc2\xa0 I think that over time people do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 And I will keep on reaching out and seeing if there are other formulas or other ways to jigger this thing into place so that we get a better result. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to the people like Mayor Bloomberg -- who is no critic of yours in general; he endorsed you -- who argues that there is some what he calls "posturing" in these claims that there are going to be big layoffs and a lot of people out of work, and thinks that the effects of the spending cuts are being overstated by the administration? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well Jessica, look, I\'ll just give you an example.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense right now has to figure out how the children of military families are going to continue with their schooling over the next several months, because teachers at these Army bases are typically civilians.\xc2\xa0 They are therefore subject to furlough, which means that they may not be able to teach one day a week. Now, I expect that we\'ll be able to manage around it.\xc2\xa0 But if I\'m a man or woman in uniform in Afghanistan right now, the notion that my spouse back home is having to worry about whether or not our kids are getting the best education possible, the notion that my school for my children on an Army base might be disrupted because Congress didn\'t act, that\'s an impact.\xc2\xa0 Now, Mayor Bloomberg and others may not feel that impact.\xc2\xa0 I suspect they won\'t.\xc2\xa0 But that family will.\xc2\xa0 The Border Patrol agents who are out there in the hot sun, doing what Congress said they\'re supposed to be doing, finding out suddenly that they\'re getting a 10-percent pay cut and having to go home and explain that to their families, I don\'t think they feel like this is an exaggerated impact.\xc2\xa0 So I guess it depends on where you sit. Now, what is absolutely true is that not everybody is going to feel it.\xc2\xa0 Not everybody is going to feel it all at once.\xc2\xa0 What is true is that the accumulation of those stories all across this country, folks who suddenly -- might have been working all their lives to get an education, just so that they can get that job and get out of welfare and they\'ve got their kid in Head Start, and now, suddenly, that Head Start slot is gone and they\'re trying to figure out how am I going to keep my job, because I can\'t afford child care for my kid; some of the suppliers for those shipbuilders down in Virginia, where you\'ve got some suppliers who are small businesses, this is all they do, and they may shut down those companies, and their employees are going to be laid off -- the accumulation of all of those stories of impact is going to make our economy weaker.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to mean less growth.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to mean hundreds of thousands of jobs lost. That is real.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we\'re not making that up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a scare tactic, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. Starting tomorrow, everybody here, all the folks who are cleaning the floors at the Capitol -- now that Congress has left, somebody is going to be vacuuming and cleaning those floors and throwing out the garbage -- they\'re going to have less pay.\xc2\xa0 The janitors, the security guards, they just got a pay cut, and they\'ve got to figure out how to manage that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s real. So I want to be very clear here.\xc2\xa0 It is absolutely true that this is not going to precipitate the kind of crisis we talked about with America defaulting and some of the problems around the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a huge financial crisis, but people are going to be hurt.\xc2\xa0 The economy will not grow as quickly as it would have.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment will not go down as quickly as it would have -- and there are lives behind that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s real.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not necessary -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem. Christi Parsons. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Christi. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, your administration weighed in yesterday on the Proposition 8 case.\xc2\xa0 A few months ago it looked like you might be averse to doing that, and I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about your deliberations and how your thinking evolved on that.\xc2\xa0 Were there conversations that were important to you?\xc2\xa0 Were there things that you read that influenced your thinking? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 As everybody here knows, last year, upon a long period of reflection, I concluded that we cannot discriminate against same-sex couples when it comes to marriage; that the basic principle that America is founded on -- the idea that we\'re all created equal -- applies to everybody, regardless of sexual orientation, as well as race or gender or religion or ethnicity.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the same evolution that I\'ve gone through is an evolution that the country as a whole has gone through.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is a profoundly positive thing.\xc2\xa0 So that when the Supreme Court essentially called the question by taking this case about California\'s law, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like that was something that this administration could avoid.\xc2\xa0 I felt it was important for us to articulate what I believe and what this administration stands for. And although I do think that we\'re seeing, on a state-by-state basis, progress being made -- more and more states recognizing same-sex couples and giving them the opportunity to marry and maintain all the benefits of marriage that heterosexual couples do -- when the Supreme Court asks, do you think that the California law, which doesn\'t provide any rationale for discriminating against same-sex couples other than just the notion that, well, they\'re same-sex couples, if the Supreme Court asks me or my Attorney General or Solicitor General, do we think that meets constitutional muster, I felt it was important for us to answer that question honestly -- and the answer is no. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given the fact that you do hold that position about gay marriage, I wonder if you thought about just -- once you made the decision to weigh in, why not just argue that marriage is a right that should be available to all people of this country? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s an argument that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made personally.\xc2\xa0 The Solicitor General in his institutional role going before the Supreme Court is obliged to answer the specific question before them.\xc2\xa0 And the specific question presented before the Court right now is whether Prop 8 and the California law is unconstitutional. And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a basic principle, which is -- which applies to all equal protection cases.\xc2\xa0 Whenever a particular group is being discriminated against, the Court asks the question, what\xe2\x80\x99s the rationale for this -- and it better be a good reason.\xc2\xa0 And if you don\'t have a good reason, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to strike it down. And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is, is that same-sex couples are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny, that the Supreme Court needs to ask the state why it\xe2\x80\x99s doing it.\xc2\xa0 And if the state doesn\'t have a good reason, it should be struck down.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the core principle as applied to this case. Now, the Court may decide that if it doesn\'t apply in this case, it probably can\'t apply in any case.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no good reason for it.\xc2\xa0 If I were on the Court, that would probably be the view that I\xe2\x80\x99d put forward.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not a judge, I\xe2\x80\x99m the President.\xc2\xa0 So the basic principle, though, is let\xe2\x80\x99s treat everybody fairly and let\xe2\x80\x99s treat everybody equally.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the brief that\'s been presented accurately reflects our views. Ari Shapiro. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 You said a few minutes ago and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly that the country has to stop careening from crisis to crisis. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Right. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with a few crises behind us and a few more crises ahead of us, taking a step back from this specific debate over the sequester, how, as the leader of this country, do you plan to stop the country from careening from crisis to crisis? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Number one is to make sure that we keep making progress wherever we can on things that are important to middle-class Americans and those who are fighting to get into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So if you set aside budget fights for a second, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to get now the Violence Against Women Act done.\xc2\xa0 The conversations that are taking place on a bipartisan basis around immigration reform are moving forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen great interest in a bipartisan fashion around how we can continue to improve our education system, including around early childhood education.\xc2\xa0 There have been constructive discussions around how do we reduce gun violence. And what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep on trying to do is to make sure that we push on those things that are important to families.\xc2\xa0 And we won\xe2\x80\x99t get everything done all at once, but we can get a lot done.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s point number one.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the budget, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done is to make a case to the American people that we have to make sure that we have a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but that deficit reduction alone is not an economic policy.\xc2\xa0 And part of the challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had here is that not only Congress, but I think Washington generally spends all its time together about deficits and doesn\'t spend a lot of time talking about how do we create jobs.\xc2\xa0 So I want to make sure that we\'re talking about both.\xc2\xa0 I think that, for example, we could put a lot of people back to work right now rebuilding our roads and bridges.\xc2\xa0 And this is deferred maintenance.\xc2\xa0 We know we\'re going to have to do it.\xc2\xa0 And I went to a bridge that connects Mitch McConnell\'s state to John Boehner\'s state, and it was a rotten bridge and everybody knows it.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll bet they really want to see that improved.\xc2\xa0 Well, how do we do it?\xc2\xa0 Let\'s have a conversation about it.\xc2\xa0 That will create jobs.\xc2\xa0 It will be good for businesses, reduce commuter times, improve commuter safety.\xc2\xa0 That has to be part of this conversation, not just this constant argument about cutting and spending. So I guess my point is, Ari, that what I want to try to do is to make sure that we\'re constantly focused, that our true north is on how are we helping American families succeed.\xc2\xa0 Deficit reduction is part of that agenda and an important part.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not the only part.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want us to be paralyzed on everything just because we disagree on this one thing.\xc2\xa0 And as I already said to Jessica, what I\'m also hoping is, is that, over time -- perhaps after Republicans step back and maybe they can say, you know what, we stuck tough on the sequester, and this makes us feel good, and the Republican caucus is in a better mood when they come back -- maybe then we can have a more serious discussion about what the real problems on deficit and deficit reduction are.\xc2\xa0 And the good thing about America is that sometimes we get to these bottlenecks and we get stuck, and you have these sharp, partisan fights, but the American people pretty steadily are common sense and practical, and eventually, that common-sense, practical approach wins out.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what will happen here as well.\xc2\xa0 And, in the meantime, just to make the final point about the sequester, we will get through this.\xc2\xa0 This is not going to be a apocalypse, I think as some people have said.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just dumb.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s going to hurt.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to hurt individual people and it\'s going to hurt the economy overall.\xc2\xa0 But if Congress comes to its senses a week from now, a month from now, three months from now, then there\'s a lot of open running room there for us to grow our economy much more quickly and to advance the agenda of the American people dramatically.\xc2\xa0 So this is a temporary stop on what I believe is the long-term, outstanding prospect for American growth and greatness.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.'
