b"Thank you!\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you!\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It is good to be back in Las Vegas!\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And it is good to be among so many good friends.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet me start off by thanking everybody at Del Sol High School for hosting us.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Go Dragons!\xc2\xa0 Let me especially thank your outstanding principal, Lisa Primas.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThere are all kinds of notable guests here, but I just want to mention a few.\xc2\xa0 First of all, our outstanding Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, is here.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Our wonderful Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Former Secretary of Labor, Hilda Solis.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important the issue we\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk about today is.\xc2\xa0 Marie Lopez Rogers from Avondale, Arizona.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Kasim Reed from Atlanta, Georgia.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Greg Stanton from Phoenix, Arizona.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And Ashley Swearengin from Fresno, California.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd all of you are here, as well as some of the top labor leaders in the country.\xc2\xa0 And we are just so grateful.\xc2\xa0 Some outstanding business leaders are here as well.\xc2\xa0 And of course, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got wonderful students here, so I could not be prouder of our students.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, those of you have a seat, feel free to take a seat.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 I love you, Mr. President!\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I love you back.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, last week, I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And during my inaugural address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have, but it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose.\xc2\xa0 It requires us to act.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI know that some issues will be harder to lift than others.\xc2\xa0 Some debates will be more contentious.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected.\xc2\xa0 But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling; where a broad consensus is emerging; and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here today because the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The time is now.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 S\xc3\xad se puede!\xc2\xa0 S\xc3\xad se puede!\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Now is the time.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m here because most Americans agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to fix a system that\xe2\x80\x99s been broken for way too long.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement, and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country\xe2\x80\x99s future.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThink about it -- we define ourselves as a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s who we are -- in our bones.\xc2\xa0 The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, that\xe2\x80\x99s always been one of our greatest strengths.\xc2\xa0 It keeps our workforce young.\xc2\xa0 It keeps our country on the cutting edge.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAfter all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo!.\xc2\xa0 They created entire new industries that, in turn, created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens.\xc2\xa0 In recent years, one in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants.\xc2\xa0 One in four new small business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada -- folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut we all know that today, we have an immigration system that\xe2\x80\x99s out of date and badly broken; a system that\xe2\x80\x99s holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nRight now, we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America; 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows.\xc2\xa0 Yes, they broke the rules.\xc2\xa0 They crossed the border illegally.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they overstayed their visas.\xc2\xa0 Those are facts.\xc2\xa0 Nobody disputes them.\xc2\xa0 But these 11 million men and women are now here.\xc2\xa0 Many of them have been here for years.\xc2\xa0 And the overwhelming majority of these individuals aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking for any trouble.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re contributing members of the community.\xc2\xa0 They're looking out for their families.\xc2\xa0 They're looking out for their neighbors.\xc2\xa0 They're woven into the fabric of our lives.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nEvery day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living.\xc2\xa0 Often they do that in a shadow economy -- a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay.\xc2\xa0 And when that happens, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just bad for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the entire economy.\xc2\xa0 Because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing -- that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules -- they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who suffer.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They've got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules.\xc2\xa0 And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened, too.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo if we're truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it into the middle class, we've got to fix the system.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0 We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable -- businesses for who they hire, and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s common sense.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s another economic reason why we need reform.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so, and the effect that has on our economy.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nRight now, there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science.\xc2\xa0 But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to leave our country.\xc2\xa0 Think about that.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIntel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.\xc2\xa0 Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.\xc2\xa0 Right now in one of those classrooms, there\xe2\x80\x99s a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea -- their Intel or Instagram -- into a big business.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how you grow new industries in America.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how you give new industries to our competitors.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, during my first term, we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFirst, we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants.\xc2\xa0 We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history.\xc2\xa0 And today, illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSecond, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities.\xc2\xa0 And today, deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd third, we took up the cause of the DREAMers -- (applause) -- the young people who were brought to this country as children, young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here.\xc2\xa0 We said that if you\xe2\x80\x99re able to meet some basic criteria like pursuing an education, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut because this change isn\xe2\x80\x99t permanent, we need Congress to act -- and not just on the DREAM Act.\xc2\xa0 We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now.\xc2\xa0 That's what we need.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, the good news is that for the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Members of both parties, in both chambers, are actively working on a solution.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles I\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed and campaigned on for the last few years.\xc2\xa0 So at this moment, it looks like there\xe2\x80\x99s a genuine desire to get this done soon, and that\xe2\x80\x99s very encouraging.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut this time, action must follow.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate.\xc2\xa0 We've been debating this a very long time.\xc2\xa0 So it's not as if we don't know technically what needs to get done.\xc2\xa0 As a consequence, to help move this process along, today I\xe2\x80\x99m laying out my ideas for immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas I\xe2\x80\x99m proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 You don't get that matchup very often.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So we know where the consensus should be.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details, and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo the principles are pretty straightforward.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of details behind it.\xc2\xa0 We're going to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we're talking about.\xc2\xa0 But the principles are pretty straightforward.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFirst, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement.\xc2\xa0 That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders.\xc2\xa0 It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers.\xc2\xa0 To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out who\xe2\x80\x99s here legally, who\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someone\xe2\x80\x99s employment status.\xc2\xa0 And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSecond, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally.\xc2\xa0 We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to lay out a path -- a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line, behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally.\xc2\xa0 That's only fair, right?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo that means it won\xe2\x80\x99t be a quick process but it will be a fair process.\xc2\xa0 And it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd the third principle is we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America.\xc2\xa0 You shouldn't have to wait years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology, or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here.\xc2\xa0 Because if you succeed, you\xe2\x80\x99ll create American businesses and American jobs.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll help us grow our economy.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll help us strengthen our middle class.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what comprehensive immigration reform looks like:\xc2\xa0 smarter enforcement; a pathway to earned citizenship; improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty straightforward.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThe question now is simple:\xc2\xa0 Do we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a government to finally put this issue behind us?\xc2\xa0 I believe that we do.\xc2\xa0 I believe that we do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut I promise you this:\xc2\xa0 The closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become.\xc2\xa0 Immigration has always been an issue that enflames passions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising.\xc2\xa0 There are few things that are more important to us as a society than who gets to come here and call our country home; who gets the privilege of becoming a citizen of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 That's a big deal.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWhen we talk about that in the abstract, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And when that happens, a lot of folks forget that most of \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d used to be \xe2\x80\x9cthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We forget that.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really important for us to remember our history.\xc2\xa0 Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else.\xc2\xa0 Somebody brought you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nKen Salazar, he\xe2\x80\x99s of Mexican American descent, but he points that his family has been living where he lives for 400 years, so he didn't immigrate anywhere.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThe Irish who left behind a land of famine.\xc2\xa0 The Germans who fled persecution.\xc2\xa0 The Scandinavians who arrived eager to pioneer out west.\xc2\xa0 The Polish.\xc2\xa0 The Russians.\xc2\xa0 The Italians.\xc2\xa0 The Chinese.\xc2\xa0 The Japanese.\xc2\xa0 The West Indians.\xc2\xa0 The huddled masses who came through Ellis Island on one coast and Angel Island on the other.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 All those folks, before they were \xe2\x80\x9cus,\xe2\x80\x9d they were \xe2\x80\x9cthem.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd when each new wave of immigrants arrived, they faced resistance from those who were already here.\xc2\xa0 They faced hardship.\xc2\xa0 They faced racism.\xc2\xa0 They faced ridicule.\xc2\xa0 But over time, as they went about their daily lives, as they earned a living, as they raised a family, as they built a community, as their kids went to school here, they did their part to build a nation.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThey were the Einsteins and the Carnegies.\xc2\xa0 But they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember, but whose actions helped make us who we are; who built this country hand by hand, brick by brick.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth, but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s still true today.\xc2\xa0 Just ask Alan Aleman.\xc2\xa0 Alan is here this afternoon -- where is Alan?\xc2\xa0 He's around here -- there he is right here.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Alan was born in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 He was brought to this country by his parents when he was a child.\xc2\xa0 Growing up, Alan went to an American school, pledged allegiance to the American flag, felt American in every way -- and he was, except for one:\xc2\xa0 on paper.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn high school, Alan watched his friends come of age -- driving around town with their new licenses, earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall.\xc2\xa0 He knew he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do those things.\xc2\xa0 But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that much.\xc2\xa0 What mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God-given potential.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLast year, when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows -- even if it's just for two years at a time -- he was one of the first to sign up.\xc2\xa0 And a few months ago he was one of the first people in Nevada to get approved.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 In that moment, Alan said, \xe2\x80\x9cI felt the fear vanish.\xc2\xa0 I felt accepted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo today, Alan is in his second year at the College of Southern Nevada.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Alan is studying to become a doctor.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 He hopes to join the Air Force.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s working hard every single day to build a better life for himself and his family.\xc2\xa0 And all he wants is the opportunity to do his part to build a better America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo in the coming weeks, as the idea of reform becomes more real and the debate becomes more heated, and there are folks who are trying to pull this thing apart, remember Alan and all those who share the same hopes and the same dreams.\xc2\xa0 Remember that this is not just a debate about policy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about men and women and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThroughout our history, that has only made our nation stronger.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s how we will make sure that this century is the same as the last:\xc2\xa0 an American century welcoming of everybody who aspires to do something more, and who is willing to work hard to do it, and is willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThank you.\xc2\xa0 God bless you.\xc2\xa0 And God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)"
