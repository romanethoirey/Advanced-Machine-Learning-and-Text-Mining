b'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, and fellow Americans: Tonight we meet at an urgent time for our country.\xc2\xa0 We continue to face an economic crisis that has left millions of our neighbors jobless, and a political crisis that\xe2\x80\x99s made things worse.\xc2\xa0 This past week, reporters have been asking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat will this speech mean for the President?\xc2\xa0 What will it mean for Congress?\xc2\xa0 How will it affect their polls, and the next election?\xe2\x80\x9d But the millions of Americans who are watching right now, they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about politics.\xc2\xa0 They have real-life concerns.\xc2\xa0 Many have spent months looking for work.\xc2\xa0 Others are doing their best just to scrape by -- giving up nights out with the family to save on gas or make the mortgage; postponing retirement to send a kid to college.\xc2\xa0 These men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work and responsibility paid off.\xc2\xa0 They believed in a country where everyone gets a fair shake and does their fair share -- where if you stepped up, did your job, and were loyal to your company, that loyalty would be rewarded with a decent salary and good benefits; maybe a raise once in a while.\xc2\xa0 If you did the right thing, you could make it.\xc2\xa0 Anybody could make it in America.\xc2\xa0 For decades now, Americans have watched that compact erode.\xc2\xa0 They have seen the decks too often stacked against them.\xc2\xa0 And they know that Washington has not always put their interests first.\xc2\xa0 The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 The question tonight is whether we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet ours.\xc2\xa0 The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The question is -- the question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those of us here tonight can\xe2\x80\x99t solve all our nation\xe2\x80\x99s woes.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers.\xc2\xa0 But we can help.\xc2\xa0 We can make a difference.\xc2\xa0 There are steps we can take right now to improve people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.\xc2\xa0 I am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass right away.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s called the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 Everything in here is the kind of proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s been supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit here tonight.\xc2\xa0 And everything in this bill will be paid for.\xc2\xa0 Everything.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) The purpose of the American Jobs Act is simple:\xc2\xa0 to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working.\xc2\xa0 It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It will provide -- it will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and give companies confidence that if they invest and if they hire, there will be customers for their products and services.\xc2\xa0 You should pass this jobs plan right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin.\xc2\xa0 And you know that while corporate profits have come roaring back, smaller companies haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 So for everyone who speaks so passionately about making life easier for \xe2\x80\x9cjob creators,\xe2\x80\x9d this plan is for you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Pass this jobs bill -- pass this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax cut if they hire new workers or if they raise workers\xe2\x80\x99 wages.\xc2\xa0 Pass this jobs bill, and all small business owners will also see their payroll taxes cut in half next year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If you have 50 employees -- if you have 50 employees making an average salary, that\xe2\x80\x99s an $80,000 tax cut.\xc2\xa0 And all businesses will be able to continue writing off the investments they make in 2012.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Democrats who have supported this kind of proposal.\xc2\xa0 Fifty House Republicans have proposed the same payroll tax cut that\xe2\x80\x99s in this plan.\xc2\xa0 You should pass it right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pass this jobs bill, and we can put people to work rebuilding America.\xc2\xa0 Everyone here knows we have badly decaying roads and bridges all over the country.\xc2\xa0 Our highways are clogged with traffic.\xc2\xa0 Our skies are the most congested in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an outrage.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Building a world-class transportation system is part of what made us a economic superpower.\xc2\xa0 And now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads?\xc2\xa0 At a time when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them right here in America?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are private construction companies all across America just waiting to get to work.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a bridge that needs repair between Ohio and Kentucky that\xe2\x80\x99s on one of the busiest trucking routes in North America.\xc2\xa0 A public transit project in Houston that will help clear up one of the worst areas of traffic in the country.\xc2\xa0 And there are schools throughout this country that desperately need renovating.\xc2\xa0 How can we expect our kids to do their best in places that are literally falling apart?\xc2\xa0 This is America.\xc2\xa0 Every child deserves a great school -- and we can give it to them, if we act now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The American Jobs Act will repair and modernize at least 35,000 schools.\xc2\xa0 It will put people to work right now fixing roofs and windows, installing science labs and high-speed Internet in classrooms all across this country.\xc2\xa0 It will rehabilitate homes and businesses in communities hit hardest by foreclosures.\xc2\xa0 It will jumpstart thousands of transportation projects all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And to make sure the money is properly spent, we\xe2\x80\x99re building on reforms we\xe2\x80\x99ve already put in place.\xc2\xa0 No more earmarks.\xc2\xa0 No more boondoggles.\xc2\xa0 No more bridges to nowhere.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re cutting the red tape that prevents some of these projects from getting started as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll set up an independent fund to attract private dollars and issue loans based on two criteria:\xc2\xa0 how badly a construction project is needed and how much good it will do for the economy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) This idea came from a bill written by a Texas Republican and a Massachusetts Democrat.\xc2\xa0 The idea for a big boost in construction is supported by America\xe2\x80\x99s largest business organization and America\xe2\x80\x99s largest labor organization.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s been supported in the past by Democrats and Republicans alike.\xc2\xa0 You should pass it right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Pass this jobs bill, and thousands of teachers in every state will go back to work.\xc2\xa0 These are the men and women charged with preparing our children for a world where the competition has never been tougher.\xc2\xa0 But while they\xe2\x80\x99re adding teachers in places like South Korea, we\xe2\x80\x99re laying them off in droves.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unfair to our kids.\xc2\xa0 It undermines their future and ours.\xc2\xa0 And it has to stop.\xc2\xa0 Pass this bill, and put our teachers back in the classroom where they belong.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get extra tax credits if they hire America\xe2\x80\x99s veterans.\xc2\xa0 We ask these men and women to leave their careers, leave their families, risk their lives to fight for our country.\xc2\xa0 The last thing they should have to do is fight for a job when they come home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Pass this bill, and hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged young people will have the hope and the dignity of a summer job next year.\xc2\xa0 And their parents -- (applause) -- their parents, low-income Americans who desperately want to work, will have more ladders out of poverty. Pass this jobs bill, and companies will get a $4,000 tax credit if they hire anyone who has spent more than six months looking for a job.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We have to do more to help the long-term unemployed in their search for work.\xc2\xa0 This jobs plan builds on a program in Georgia that several Republican leaders have highlighted, where people who collect unemployment insurance participate in temporary work as a way to build their skills while they look for a permanent job.\xc2\xa0 The plan also extends unemployment insurance for another year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If the millions of unemployed Americans stopped getting this insurance, and stopped using that money for basic necessities, it would be a devastating blow to this economy.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and Republicans in this chamber have supported unemployment insurance plenty of times in the past.\xc2\xa0 And in this time of prolonged hardship, you should pass it again -- right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Pass this jobs bill, and the typical working family will get a $1,500 tax cut next year.\xc2\xa0 Fifteen hundred dollars that would have been taken out of your pocket will go into your pocket.\xc2\xa0 This expands on the tax cut that Democrats and Republicans already passed for this year.\xc2\xa0 If we allow that tax cut to expire -- if we refuse to act -- middle-class families will get hit with a tax increase at the worst possible time.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen.\xc2\xa0 I know that some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live.\xc2\xa0 Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 It will lead to new jobs for construction workers, for teachers, for veterans, for first responders, young people and the long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0 It will provide tax credits to companies that hire new workers, tax relief to small business owners, and tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing I want the American people to know:\xc2\xa0 The American Jobs Act will not add to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 It will be paid for.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s how.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThe agreement we passed in July will cut government spending by about $1 trillion over the next 10 years.\xc2\xa0 It also charges this Congress to come up with an additional $1.5 trillion in savings by Christmas.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, I am asking you to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 And a week from Monday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be releasing a more ambitious deficit plan -- a plan that will not only cover the cost of this jobs bill, but stabilize our debt in the long run.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This approach is basically the one I\xe2\x80\x99ve been advocating for months.\xc2\xa0 In addition to the trillion dollars of spending cuts I\xe2\x80\x99ve already signed into law, it\xe2\x80\x99s a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by making additional spending cuts, by making modest adjustments to health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and by reforming our tax code in a way that asks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the spending cuts wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen so abruptly that they\xe2\x80\x99d be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right away.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I realize there are some in my party who don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should make any changes at all to Medicare and Medicaid, and I understand their concerns.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the truth:\xc2\xa0 Millions of Americans rely on Medicare in their retirement.\xc2\xa0 And millions more will do so in the future.\xc2\xa0 They pay for this benefit during their working years.\xc2\xa0 They earn it.\xc2\xa0 But with an aging population and rising health care costs, we are spending too fast to sustain the program.\xc2\xa0 And if we don\xe2\x80\x99t gradually reform the system while protecting current beneficiaries, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be there when future retirees need it.\xc2\xa0 We have to reform Medicare to strengthen it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I am also -- I\xe2\x80\x99m also well aware that there are many Republicans who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we should raise taxes on those who are most fortunate and can best afford it.\xc2\xa0 But here is what every American knows:\xc2\xa0 While most people in this country struggle to make ends meet, a few of the most affluent citizens and most profitable corporations enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody else gets.\xc2\xa0 Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary -- an outrage he has asked us to fix.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We need a tax code where everyone gets a fair shake and where everybody pays their fair share.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And by the way, I believe the vast majority of wealthy Americans and CEOs are willing to do just that if it helps the economy grow and gets our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll also offer ideas to reform a corporate tax code that stands as a monument to special interest influence in Washington.\xc2\xa0 By eliminating pages of loopholes and deductions, we can lower one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Our tax code should not give an advantage to companies that can afford the best-connected lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 It should give an advantage to companies that invest and create jobs right here in the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for this jobs plan in the process.\xc2\xa0 But in order to do this, we have to decide what our priorities are.\xc2\xa0 We have to ask ourselves, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to grow the economy and create jobs?\xe2\x80\x9d Should we keep tax loopholes for oil companies?\xc2\xa0 Or should we use that money to give small business owners a tax credit when they hire new workers?\xc2\xa0 Because we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to do both.\xc2\xa0 Should we keep tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires?\xc2\xa0 Or should we put teachers back to work so our kids can graduate ready for college and good jobs?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Right now, we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to do both.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t political grandstanding.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t class warfare.\xc2\xa0 This is simple math.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is simple math.\xc2\xa0 These are real choices.\xc2\xa0 These are real choices that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not even close.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s time for us to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for our future.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the American Jobs Act answers the urgent need to create jobs right away.\xc2\xa0 But we can\xe2\x80\x99t stop there.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve argued since I ran for this office, we have to look beyond the immediate crisis and start building an economy that lasts into the future -- an economy that creates good, middle-class jobs that pay well and offer security.\xc2\xa0 We now live in a world where technology has made it possible for companies to take their business anywhere.\xc2\xa0 If we want them to start here and stay here and hire here, we have to be able to out-build and out-educate and out-innovate every other country on Earth.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And this task of making America more competitive for the long haul, that\xe2\x80\x99s a job for all of us.\xc2\xa0 For government and for private companies.\xc2\xa0 For states and for local communities -- and for every American citizen.\xc2\xa0 All of us will have to up our game.\xc2\xa0 All of us will have to change the way we do business.\xc2\xa0 My administration can and will take some steps to improve our competitiveness on our own.\xc2\xa0 For example, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a small business owner who has a contract with the federal government, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure you get paid a lot faster than you do right now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also planning to cut away the red tape that prevents too many rapidly growing startup companies from raising capital and going public.\xc2\xa0 And to help responsible homeowners, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with federal housing agencies to help more people refinance their mortgages at interest rates that are now near 4 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a step -- (applause) -- I know you guys must be for this, because that\xe2\x80\x99s a step that can put more than $2,000 a year in a family\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, and give a lift to an economy still burdened by the drop in housing prices.\xc2\xa0 So, some things we can do on our own.\xc2\xa0 Other steps will require congressional action.\xc2\xa0 Today you passed reform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that entrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible. That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of action we need.\xc2\xa0 Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea -\xe2\x80\x93 while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cMade in America.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we need to get done.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And on all of our efforts to strengthen competitiveness, we need to look for ways to work side by side with America\xe2\x80\x99s businesses.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought together a Jobs Council of leaders from different industries who are developing a wide range of new ideas to help companies grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Already, we\xe2\x80\x99ve mobilized business leaders to train 10,000 American engineers a year, by providing company internships and training.\xc2\xa0 Other businesses are covering tuition for workers who learn new skills at community colleges.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure the next generation of manufacturing takes root not in China or Europe, but right here, in the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause)\xc2\xa0 If we provide the right incentives, the right support -- and if we make sure our trading partners play by the rules -- we can be the ones to build everything from fuel-efficient cars to advanced biofuels to semiconductors that we sell all around the world.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how America can be number one again.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s how America will be number one again.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I realize that some of you have a different theory on how to grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 Some of you sincerely believe that the only solution to our economic challenges is to simply cut most government spending and eliminate most government regulations.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWell, I agree that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford wasteful spending, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll work with you, with Congress, to root it out.\xc2\xa0 And I agree that there are some rules and regulations that do put an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time when they can least afford it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I ordered a review of all government regulations.\xc2\xa0 So far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified over 500 reforms, which will save billions of dollars over the next few years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We should have no more regulation than the health, safety and security of the American people require.\xc2\xa0 Every rule should meet that common-sense test.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But what we can\xe2\x80\x99t do -- what I will not do -- is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for decades.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and their safety.\xc2\xa0 I reject the argument that says for the economy to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban hidden fees by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from being exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchanging patients.\xc2\xa0 I reject the idea that we have to strip away collective bargaining rights to compete in a global economy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards.\xc2\xa0 America should be in a race to the top.\xc2\xa0 And I believe we can win that race.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everybody\xe2\x80\x99s money, and let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone they\xe2\x80\x99re on their own -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the story of America.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, we are rugged individualists.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we are strong and self-reliant.\xc2\xa0 And it has been the drive and initiative of our workers and entrepreneurs that has made this economy the engine and the envy of the world. But there\xe2\x80\x99s always been another thread running throughout our history -- a belief that we\xe2\x80\x99re all connected, and that there are some things we can only do together, as a nation. We all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union.\xc2\xa0 Founder of the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 But in the middle of a civil war, he was also a leader who looked to the future -- a Republican President who mobilized government to build the Transcontinental Railroad -- (applause) -- launch the National Academy of Sciences, set up the first land grant colleges.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And leaders of both parties have followed the example he set.\xc2\xa0 Ask yourselves -- where would we be right now if the people who sat here before us decided not to build our highways, not to build our bridges, our dams, our airports?\xc2\xa0 What would this country be like if we had chosen not to spend money on public high schools, or research universities, or community colleges?\xc2\xa0 Millions of returning heroes, including my grandfather, had the opportunity to go to school because of the G.I. Bill.\xc2\xa0 Where would we be if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had that chance?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many jobs would it have cost us if past Congresses decided not to support the basic research that led to the Internet and the computer chip?\xc2\xa0 What kind of country would this be if this chamber had voted down Social Security or Medicare just because it violated some rigid idea about what government could or could not do?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 How many Americans would have suffered as a result?\xc2\xa0 No single individual built America on their own.\xc2\xa0 We built it together.\xc2\xa0 We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another.\xc2\xa0 And members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Every proposal I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out tonight is the kind that\xe2\x80\x99s been supported by Democrats and Republicans in the past.\xc2\xa0 Every proposal I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out tonight will be paid for.\xc2\xa0 And every proposal is designed to meet the urgent needs of our people and our communities.\xc2\xa0 Now, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of skepticism about whether the politics of the moment will allow us to pass this jobs plan -- or any jobs plan.\xc2\xa0 Already, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the same old press releases and tweets flying back and forth.\xc2\xa0 Already, the media has proclaimed that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to bridge our differences.\xc2\xa0 And maybe some of you have decided that those differences are so great that we can only resolve them at the ballot box.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But know this:\xc2\xa0 The next election is 14 months away.\xc2\xa0 And the people who sent us here -- the people who hired us to work for them -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of waiting 14 months.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Some of them are living week to week, paycheck to paycheck, even day to day.\xc2\xa0 They need help, and they need it now.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that this plan will solve all our problems. It should not be, nor will it be, the last plan of action we propose.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s guided us from the start of this crisis hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the search for a silver bullet.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a commitment to stay at it -- to be persistent -- to keep trying every new idea that works, and listen to every good proposal, no matter which party comes up with it.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of the arguments we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past, regardless of the arguments we will have in the future, this plan is the right thing to do right now.\xc2\xa0 You should pass it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And I intend to take that message to every corner of this country.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And I ask -- I ask every American who agrees to lift your voice:\xc2\xa0 Tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now.\xc2\xa0 Tell Washington that doing nothing is not an option.\xc2\xa0 Remind us that if we act as one nation and one people, we have it within our power to meet this challenge. President Kennedy once said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur problems are man-made \xe2\x80\x93- therefore they can be solved by man.\xc2\xa0 And man can be as big as he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d These are difficult years for our country.\xc2\xa0 But we are Americans.\xc2\xa0 We are tougher than the times we live in, and we are bigger than our politics have been.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s meet the moment.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to work, and let\xe2\x80\x99s show the world once again why the United States of America remains the greatest nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
