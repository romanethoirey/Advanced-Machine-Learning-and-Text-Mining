b'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And as we mark this occasion, we\xe2\x80\x99re also mindful of the empty chair in this chamber, and we pray for the health of our colleague -- and our friend -\xe2\x80\x93 Gabby Giffords.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences over the last two years.\xc2\xa0 The debates have been contentious; we have fought fiercely for our beliefs.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what a robust democracy demands.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what helps set us apart as a nation.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all the noise and passion and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded us that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a part of something greater -\xe2\x80\x93 something more consequential than party or political preference.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are part of the American family.\xc2\xa0 We believe that in a country where every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still bound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common creed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different than those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to be fulfilled.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That, too, is what sets us apart as a nation.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, by itself, this simple recognition won\xe2\x80\x99t usher in a new era of cooperation.\xc2\xa0 What comes of this moment is up to us.\xc2\xa0 What comes of this moment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, but whether we can work together tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe we can.\xc2\xa0 And I believe we must.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the people who sent us here expect of us.\xc2\xa0 With their votes, they\xe2\x80\x99ve determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties.\xc2\xa0 New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We will move forward together, or not at all -\xe2\x80\x93 for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At stake right now is not who wins the next election -\xe2\x80\x93 after all, we just had an election.\xc2\xa0 At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country, or somewhere else.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but the light to the world.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are poised for progress.\xc2\xa0 Two years after the worst recession most of us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back.\xc2\xa0 Corporate profits are up.\xc2\xa0 The economy is growing again.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone.\xc2\xa0 We measure progress by the success of our people.\xc2\xa0 By the jobs they can find and the quality of life those jobs offer.\xc2\xa0 By the prospects of a small business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving enterprise.\xc2\xa0 By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to our children.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the project the American people want us to work on. Together.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We did that in December.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans\xe2\x80\x99 paychecks are a little bigger today.\xc2\xa0 Every business can write off the full cost of new investments that they make this year.\xc2\xa0 And these steps, taken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to the more than one million private sector jobs created last year.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we have to do more.\xc2\xa0 These steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken over the last two years may have broken the back of this recession, but to win the future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the making.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when finding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business downtown.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t always need a degree, and your competition was pretty much limited to your neighbors.\xc2\xa0 If you worked hard, chances are you\xe2\x80\x99d have a job for life, with a decent paycheck and good benefits and the occasional promotion.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99d even have the pride of seeing your kids work at the same company.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That world has changed.\xc2\xa0 And for many, the change has been painful.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and the vacant storefronts on once busy Main Streets. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it in the frustrations of Americans who\xe2\x80\x99ve seen their paychecks dwindle or their jobs disappear -\xe2\x80\x93 proud men and women who feel like the rules have been changed in the middle of the game.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xc2\xa0 The rules have changed.\xc2\xa0 In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business.\xc2\xa0 Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the same work with 100.\xc2\xa0 Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their products wherever there\xe2\x80\x99s an Internet connection.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on math and science.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re investing in research and new technologies.\xc2\xa0 Just recently, China became the home to the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest private solar research facility, and the world\xe2\x80\x99s fastest computer.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yes, the world has changed.\xc2\xa0 The competition for jobs is real.\xc2\xa0 But this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t discourage us.\xc2\xa0 It should challenge us. Remember -\xe2\x80\x93 for all the hits we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken these last few years, for all the naysayers predicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 No workers -- no workers are more productive than ours.\xc2\xa0 No country has more successful companies, or grants more patents to inventors and entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the home to the world\xe2\x80\x99s best colleges and universities, where more students come to study than any place on Earth.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s more, we are the first nation to be founded for the sake of an idea -\xe2\x80\x93 the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own destiny.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked everything to come here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why our students don\xe2\x80\x99t just memorize equations, but answer questions like \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of that idea?\xc2\xa0 What would you change about the world?\xc2\xa0 What do you want to be when you grow up?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The future is ours to win.\xc2\xa0 But to get there, we can\xe2\x80\x99t just stand still.\xc2\xa0 As Robert Kennedy told us, \xe2\x80\x9cThe future is not a gift.\xc2\xa0 It is an achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Sustaining the American Dream has never been about standing pat.\xc2\xa0 It has required each generation to sacrifice, and struggle, and meet the demands of a new age.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And now it\xe2\x80\x99s our turn.\xc2\xa0 We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and industries of our time.\xc2\xa0 We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We have to make America the best place on Earth to do business.\xc2\xa0 We need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how our people will prosper.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99ll win the future.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk about how we get there.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first step in winning the future is encouraging American innovation.\xc2\xa0 None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will be or where the new jobs will come from.\xc2\xa0 Thirty years ago, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t know that something called the Internet would lead to an economic revolution.\xc2\xa0 What we can do -- what America does better than anyone else -- is spark the creativity and imagination of our people.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the nation that put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the nation of Edison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook.\xc2\xa0 In America, innovation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just change our lives.\xc2\xa0 It is how we make our living.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation.\xc2\xa0 But because it\xe2\x80\x99s not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, throughout our history, our government has provided cutting-edge scientists and inventors with the support that they need.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what planted the seeds for the Internet.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what helped make possible things like computer chips and GPS.\xc2\xa0 Just think of all the good jobs -- from manufacturing to retail -- that have come from these breakthroughs.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we would beat them to the moon.\xc2\xa0 The science wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even there yet.\xc2\xa0 NASA didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xc2\xa0 But after investing in better research and education, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t just surpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is our generation\xe2\x80\x99s Sputnik moment.\xc2\xa0 Two years ago, I said that we needed to reach a level of research and development we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen since the height of the Space Race.\xc2\xa0 And in a few weeks, I will be sending a budget to Congress that helps us meet that goal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll invest in biomedical research, information technology, and especially clean energy technology -\xe2\x80\x93 (applause) -- an investment that will strengthen our security, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our people.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Already, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the promise of renewable energy.\xc2\xa0 Robert and Gary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company.\xc2\xa0 After September 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit them hard.\xc2\xa0 Today, with the help of a government loan, that empty space is being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all across the country.\xc2\xa0 In Robert\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cWe reinvented ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented ourselves.\xc2\xa0 And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to reinvent our energy policy. We\xe2\x80\x99re not just handing out money.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re issuing a challenge.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re telling America\xe2\x80\x99s scientists and engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their fields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we\xe2\x80\x99ll fund the Apollo projects of our time.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the California Institute of Technology, they\xe2\x80\x99re developing a way to turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars.\xc2\xa0 At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, they\xe2\x80\x99re using supercomputers to get a lot more power out of our nuclear facilities.\xc2\xa0 With more research and incentives, we can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first country to have a million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We need to get behind this innovation.\xc2\xa0 And to help pay for it, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we currently give to oil companies.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed, but they\xe2\x80\x99re doing just fine on their own.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So instead of subsidizing yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s energy, let\xe2\x80\x99s invest in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy jobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they\xe2\x80\x99re selling.\xc2\xa0 So tonight, I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal:\xc2\xa0 By 2035, 80 percent of America\xe2\x80\x99s electricity will come from clean energy sources.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some folks want wind and solar.\xc2\xa0 Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas.\xc2\xa0 To meet this goal, we will need them all -- and I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it happen.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to America\xe2\x80\x99s success.\xc2\xa0 But if we want to win the future -\xe2\x80\x93 if we want innovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas -\xe2\x80\x93 then we also have to win the race to educate our kids.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Think about it.\xc2\xa0 Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school education.\xc2\xa0 And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren\xe2\x80\x99t even finishing high school.\xc2\xa0 The quality of our math and science education lags behind many other nations.\xc2\xa0 America has fallen to ninth in the proportion of young people with a college degree.\xc2\xa0 And so the question is whether all of us \xe2\x80\x93- as citizens, and as parents \xe2\x80\x93- are willing to do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to give every child a chance to succeed.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes and communities.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s family that first instills the love of learning in a child.\xc2\xa0 Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and homework gets done.\xc2\xa0 We need to teach our kids that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We need to teach them that success is not a function of fame or PR, but of hard work and discipline.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our schools share this responsibility.\xc2\xa0 When a child walks into a classroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high performance.\xc2\xa0 But too many schools don\xe2\x80\x99t meet this test. That\xe2\x80\x99s why instead of just pouring money into a system that\xe2\x80\x99s not working, we launched a competition called Race to the Top.\xc2\xa0 To all 50 states, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher quality and student achievement, we\xe2\x80\x99ll show you the money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools in a generation.\xc2\xa0 For less than 1 percent of what we spend on education each year, it has led over 40 states to raise their standards for teaching and learning.\xc2\xa0 And these standards were developed, by the way, not by Washington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year as we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that\xe2\x80\x99s more flexible and focused on what\xe2\x80\x99s best for our kids.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You see, we know what\xe2\x80\x99s possible from our children when reform isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals, school boards and communities.\xc2\xa0 Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver.\xc2\xa0 Three years ago, it was rated one of the worst schools in Colorado -- located on turf between two rival gangs.\xc2\xa0 But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their diploma.\xc2\xa0 Most will be the first in their families to go to college.\xc2\xa0 And after the first year of the school\xe2\x80\x99s transformation, the principal who made it possible wiped away tears when a student said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Ms. Waters, for showing that we are smart and we can make it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what good schools can do, and we want good schools all across the country.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child\xe2\x80\x99s success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom.\xc2\xa0 In South Korea, teachers are known as \xe2\x80\x9cnation builders.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Here in America, it\xe2\x80\x99s time we treated the people who educate our children with the same level of respect.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, to every young person listening tonight who\xe2\x80\x99s contemplating their career choice:\xc2\xa0 If you want to make a difference in the life of our nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child -- become a teacher.\xc2\xa0 Your country needs you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course, the education race doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end with a high school diploma.\xc2\xa0 To compete, higher education must be within the reach of every American.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to banks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of students.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And this year, I ask Congress to go further, and make permanent our tuition tax credit \xe2\x80\x93- worth $10,000 for four years of college.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today\xe2\x80\x99s fast-changing economy, we\xe2\x80\x99re also revitalizing America\xe2\x80\x99s community colleges.\xc2\xa0 Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town.\xc2\xa0 One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old.\xc2\xa0 And she told me she\xe2\x80\x99s earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams, too.\xc2\xa0 As Kathy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope it tells them to never give up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we take these steps -\xe2\x80\x93 if we raise expectations for every child, and give them the best possible chance at an education, from the day they are born until the last job they take \xe2\x80\x93- we will reach the goal that I set two years ago:\xc2\xa0 By the end of the decade, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last point about education.\xc2\xa0 Today, there are hundreds of thousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American citizens.\xc2\xa0 Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had nothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as Americans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.\xc2\xa0 Others come here from abroad to study in our colleges and universities.\xc2\xa0 But as soon as they obtain advanced degrees, we send them back home to compete against us.\xc2\xa0 It makes no sense.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration.\xc2\xa0 And I am prepared to work with Republicans and Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws and address the millions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I know that debate will be difficult.\xc2\xa0 I know it will take time.\xc2\xa0 But tonight, let\xe2\x80\x99s agree to make that effort.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s stop expelling talented, responsible young people who could be staffing our research labs or starting a new business, who could be further enriching this nation.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America.\xc2\xa0 To attract new businesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to move people, goods, and information -- from high-speed rail to high-speed Internet.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our infrastructure used to be the best, but our lead has slipped.\xc2\xa0 South Korean homes now have greater Internet access than we do.\xc2\xa0 Countries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways than we do.\xc2\xa0 China is building faster trains and newer airports.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, when our own engineers graded our nation\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure, they gave us a \xe2\x80\x9cD.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have to do better.\xc2\xa0 America is the nation that built the transcontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, constructed the Interstate Highway System.\xc2\xa0 The jobs created by these projects didn\xe2\x80\x99t just come from laying down track or pavement.\xc2\xa0 They came from businesses that opened near a town\xe2\x80\x99s new train station or the new off-ramp.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So over the last two years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun rebuilding for the 21st century, a project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit construction industry.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m proposing that we redouble those efforts.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and bridges.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure this is fully paid for, attract private investment, and pick projects based [on] what\xe2\x80\x99s best for the economy, not politicians.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access to high-speed rail.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This could allow you to go places in half the time it takes to travel by car.\xc2\xa0 For some trips, it will be faster than flying \xe2\x80\x93- without the pat-down.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\xc2\xa0 As we speak, routes in California and the Midwest are already underway.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Within the next five years, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it possible for businesses to deploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 percent of all Americans.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about -- (applause) -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about faster Internet or fewer dropped calls.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about connecting every part of America to the digital age.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where farmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products all over the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a firefighter who can download the design of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can take classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-to-face video chats with her doctor.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All these investments -\xe2\x80\x93 in innovation, education, and infrastructure \xe2\x80\x93- will make America a better place to do business and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 But to help our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that stand in the way of their success.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For example, over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to benefit particular companies and industries.\xc2\xa0 Those with accountants or lawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all.\xc2\xa0 But all the rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world.\xc2\xa0 It makes no sense, and it has to change.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the system.\xc2\xa0 Get rid of the loopholes.\xc2\xa0 Level the playing field.\xc2\xa0 And use the savings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 years \xe2\x80\x93- without adding to our deficit.\xc2\xa0 It can be done.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of doubling our exports by 2014 -\xe2\x80\x93 because the more we export, the more jobs we create here at home.\xc2\xa0 Already, our exports are up.\xc2\xa0 Recently, we signed agreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And last month, we finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs.\xc2\xa0 This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans -- and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade agreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with American workers and promote American jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we did with Korea, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with Panama and Colombia and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade talks.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered a review of government regulations.\xc2\xa0 When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But I will not hesitate to create or enforce common-sense safeguards to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in this country for more than a century.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we have speed limits and child labor laws.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies and new rules to prevent another financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I have heard rumors that a few of you still have concerns about our new health care law.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So let me be the first to say that anything can be improved.\xc2\xa0 If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making care better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you.\xc2\xa0 We can start right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to do -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance companies could deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient from Texas, that his treatment might not be covered.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to tell Jim Houser, a small business man from Oregon, that he has to go back to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees.\xc2\xa0 As we speak, this law is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving uninsured students a chance to stay on their patients\xe2\x80\x99 -- parents\xe2\x80\x99 coverage.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I say to this chamber tonight, instead of re-fighting the battles of the last two years, let\xe2\x80\x99s fix what needs fixing and let\xe2\x80\x99s move forward.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the final critical step in winning the future is to make sure we aren\xe2\x80\x99t buried under a mountain of debt.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a decade ago.\xc2\xa0 And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was necessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront the fact that our government spends more than it takes in.\xc2\xa0 That is not sustainable.\xc2\xa0 Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means.\xc2\xa0 They deserve a government that does the same.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Now, this would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring discretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This freeze will require painful cuts.\xc2\xa0 Already, we\xe2\x80\x99ve frozen the salaries of hardworking federal employees for the next two years.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action programs.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of billions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our military can do without.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I recognize that some in this chamber have already proposed deeper cuts, and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to do without.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing it on the backs of our most vulnerable citizens.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that what we\xe2\x80\x99re cutting is really excess weight.\xc2\xa0 Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine.\xc2\xa0 It may make you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re flying high at first, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t take long before you feel the impact.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, most of the cuts and savings I\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed only address annual domestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of our budget.\xc2\xa0 To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that cutting this kind of spending alone will be enough.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The bipartisan fiscal commission I created last year made this crystal clear.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with all their proposals, but they made important progress.\xc2\xa0 And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle our deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it \xe2\x80\x93- in domestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending through tax breaks and loopholes.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This means further reducing health care costs, including programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to our long-term deficit.\xc2\xa0 The health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising costs, which is part of the reason that nonpartisan economists have said that repealing the health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our deficit.\xc2\xa0 Still, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, including one that Republicans suggested last year -- medical malpractice reform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security for future generations.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We must do it without putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or people with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future generations; and without subjecting Americans\xe2\x80\x99 guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Before we take money away from our schools or scholarships away from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax break.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of punishing their success.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about promoting America\xe2\x80\x99s success.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to simplify the individual tax code.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This will be a tough job, but members of both parties have expressed an interest in doing this, and I am prepared to join them.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So now is the time to act.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time for both sides and both houses of Congress \xe2\x80\x93- Democrats and Republicans -\xe2\x80\x93 to forge a principled compromise that gets the job done.\xc2\xa0 If we make the hard choices now to rein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the future.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me take this one step further.\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just give our people a government that\xe2\x80\x99s more affordable.\xc2\xa0 We should give them a government that\xe2\x80\x99s more competent and more efficient.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t win the future with a government of the past.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We live and do business in the Information Age, but the last major reorganization of the government happened in the age of black-and-white TV.\xc2\xa0 There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports.\xc2\xa0 There are at least five different agencies that deal with housing policy.\xc2\xa0 Then there\xe2\x80\x99s my favorite example:\xc2\xa0 The Interior Department is in charge of salmon while they\xe2\x80\x99re in fresh water, but the Commerce Department handles them when they\xe2\x80\x99re in saltwater.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I hear it gets even more complicated once they\xe2\x80\x99re smoked.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made great strides over the last two years in using technology and getting rid of waste.\xc2\xa0 Veterans can now download their electronic medical records with a click of the mouse.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re selling acres of federal office space that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been used in years, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll cut through red tape to get rid of more.\xc2\xa0 But we need to think bigger.\xc2\xa0 In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America.\xc2\xa0 I will submit that proposal to Congress for a vote \xe2\x80\x93- and we will push to get it passed.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the coming year, we\xe2\x80\x99ll also work to rebuild people\xe2\x80\x99s faith in the institution of government.\xc2\xa0 Because you deserve to know exactly how and where your tax dollars are being spent, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to go to a website and get that information for the very first time in history.\xc2\xa0 Because you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting with lobbyists, I ask Congress to do what the White House has already done -- put that information online.\xc2\xa0 And because the American people deserve to know that special interests aren\xe2\x80\x99t larding up legislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know this:\xc2\xa0 If a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.\xc2\xa0 I will veto it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 21st century government that\xe2\x80\x99s open and competent.\xc2\xa0 A government that lives within its means.\xc2\xa0 An economy that\xe2\x80\x99s driven by new skills and new ideas.\xc2\xa0 Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, responsibility, and innovation.\xc2\xa0 It will also require us to approach that world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new threats and new challenges.\xc2\xa0 No single wall separates East and West.\xc2\xa0 No one rival superpower is aligned against us.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so we must defeat determined enemies, wherever they are, and build coalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion.\xc2\xa0 And America\xe2\x80\x99s moral example must always shine for all who yearn for freedom and justice and dignity.\xc2\xa0 And because we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun this work, tonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and America\xe2\x80\x99s standing has been restored.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have left with their heads held high.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 American combat patrols have ended, violence is down, and a new government has been formed.\xc2\xa0 This year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the Iraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment has been kept.\xc2\xa0 The Iraq war is coming to an end.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we\xe2\x80\x99re disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies.\xc2\xa0 And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our borders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with respect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American Muslims are a part of our American family.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad.\xc2\xa0 In Afghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 Our purpose is clear:\xc2\xa0 By preventing the Taliban from reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny al Qaeda the safe haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under the control of the insurgency.\xc2\xa0 There will be tough fighting ahead, and the Afghan government will need to deliver better governance.\xc2\xa0 But we are strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an enduring partnership with them.\xc2\xa0 This year, we will work with nearly 50 countries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead.\xc2\xa0 And this July, we will begin to bring our troops home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Pakistan, al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001.\xc2\xa0 Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 Their safe havens are shrinking.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe:\xc2\xa0 We will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the worst weapons of war.\xc2\xa0 Because Republicans and Democrats approved the New START treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be deployed.\xc2\xa0 Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being locked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of terrorists.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its obligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher sanctions, tighter sanctions than ever before.\xc2\xa0 And on the Korean Peninsula, we stand with our ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment to abandon nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is just a part of how we\xe2\x80\x99re shaping a world that favors peace and prosperity.\xc2\xa0 With our European allies, we revitalized NATO and increased our cooperation on everything from counterterrorism to missile defense.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reset our relationship with Russia, strengthened Asian alliances, built new partnerships with nations like India.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador to forge new alliances across the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Around the globe, we\xe2\x80\x99re standing with those who take responsibility -\xe2\x80\x93 helping farmers grow more food, supporting doctors who care for the sick, and combating the corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be our power -\xe2\x80\x93 it must also be the purpose behind it.\xc2\xa0 In south Sudan -\xe2\x80\x93 with our assistance -\xe2\x80\x93 the people were finally able to vote for independence after years of war.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thousands lined up before dawn.\xc2\xa0 People danced in the streets.\xc2\xa0 One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the scene around him:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThis was a battlefield for most of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cNow we want to be free.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the people proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, let us be clear:\xc2\xa0 The United States of America stands with the people of Tunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We must never forget that the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled for, and fought for, live in the hearts of people everywhere.\xc2\xa0 And we must always remember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this struggle are the men and women who serve our country.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our nation is united in support of our troops and their families.\xc2\xa0 Let us serve them as well as they\xe2\x80\x99ve served us -- by giving them the equipment they need, by providing them with the care and benefits that they have earned, and by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own nation.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our troops come from every corner of this country -\xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American.\xc2\xa0 They are Christian and Hindu, Jewish and Muslim.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, we know that some of them are gay.\xc2\xa0 Starting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the country they love because of who they love.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And with that change, I call on all our college campuses to open their doors to our military recruiters and ROTC.\xc2\xa0 It is time to leave behind the divisive battles of the past.\xc2\xa0 It is time to move forward as one nation.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our schools, changing the way we use energy, reducing our deficit \xe2\x80\x93- none of this will be easy.\xc2\xa0 All of it will take time.\xc2\xa0 And it will be harder because we will argue about everything.\xc2\xa0 The costs.\xc2\xa0 The details.\xc2\xa0 The letter of every law.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course, some countries don\xe2\x80\x99t have this problem.\xc2\xa0 If the central government wants a railroad, they build a railroad, no matter how many homes get bulldozed.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t want a bad story in the newspaper, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get written.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy can sometimes be, I know there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a person here who would trade places with any other nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights enshrined in our Constitution.\xc2\xa0 We may have different opinions, but we believe in the same promise that says this is a place where you can make it if you try.\xc2\xa0 We may have different backgrounds, but we believe in the same dream that says this is a country where anything is possible.\xc2\xa0 No matter who you are.\xc2\xa0 No matter where you come from.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight.\xc2\xa0 That dream is why a working-class kid from Scranton can sit behind me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\xc2\xa0 That dream is why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father\xe2\x80\x99s Cincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That dream -\xe2\x80\x93 that American Dream -\xe2\x80\x93 is what drove the Allen Brothers to reinvent their roofing company for a new era.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what drove those students at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the future.\xc2\xa0 And that dream is the story of a small business owner named Brandon Fisher.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes in a new kind of drilling technology.\xc2\xa0 And one day last summer, he saw the news that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean mine, and no one knew how to save them.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Brandon thought his company could help.\xc2\xa0 And so he designed a rescue that would come to be known as Plan B.\xc2\xa0 His employees worked around the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment.\xc2\xa0 And Brandon left for Chile.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000-foot hole into the ground, working three- or four-hour -- three or four days at a time without any sleep.\xc2\xa0 Thirty-seven days later, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want all of the attention, Brandon wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there when the miners emerged.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99d already gone back home, back to work on his next project.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And later, one of his employees said of the rescue, \xe2\x80\x9cWe proved that Center Rock is a little company, but we do big things.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do big things.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of ordinary people who dare to dream.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we win the future.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a nation that says, \xe2\x80\x9cI might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how we\xe2\x80\x99ll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we\xe2\x80\x99ll get there.\xc2\xa0 I know we will.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do big things.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The idea of America endures.\xc2\xa0 Our destiny remains our choice.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, more than two centuries later, it\xe2\x80\x99s because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
