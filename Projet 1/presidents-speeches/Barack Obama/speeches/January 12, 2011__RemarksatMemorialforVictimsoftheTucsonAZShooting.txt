b'Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Please, please be seated.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) To the families of those we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost; to all who called them friends; to the students of this university, the public servants who are gathered here, the people of Tucson and the people of Arizona:\xc2\xa0 I have come here tonight as an American who, like all Americans, kneels to pray with you today and will stand by you tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts.\xc2\xa0 But know this:\xc2\xa0 The hopes of a nation are here tonight.\xc2\xa0 We mourn with you for the fallen.\xc2\xa0 We join you in your grief.\xc2\xa0 And we add our faith to yours that Representative Gabrielle Giffords and the other living victims of this tragedy will pull through.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Scripture tells us: There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God,\r\nthe holy place where the Most High dwells.\r\nGod is within her, she will not fall;\r\nGod will help her at break of day. On Saturday morning, Gabby, her staff and many of her constituents gathered outside a supermarket to exercise their right to peaceful assembly and free speech.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned by our founders \xe2\x80\x93- representatives of the people answering questions to their constituents, so as to carry their concerns back to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.\xc2\xa0 Gabby called it \xe2\x80\x9cCongress on Your Corner\xe2\x80\x9d -\xe2\x80\x93 just an updated version of government of and by and for the people.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And that quintessentially American scene, that was the scene that was shattered by a gunman\xe2\x80\x99s bullets.\xc2\xa0 And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday \xe2\x80\x93- they, too, represented what is best in us, what is best in America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Judge John Roll served our legal system for nearly 40 years. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 A graduate of this university and a graduate of this law school -- (applause) -- Judge Roll was recommended for the federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago -- (applause) -- appointed by President George H.W. Bush and rose to become Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s chief federal judge.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 His colleagues described him as the hardest-working judge within the Ninth Circuit.\xc2\xa0 He was on his way back from attending Mass, as he did every day, when he decided to stop by and say hi to his representative.\xc2\xa0 John is survived by his loving wife, Maureen, his three sons and his five beautiful grandchildren.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) George and Dorothy Morris -\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cDot\xe2\x80\x9d to her friends -\xe2\x80\x93 were high school sweethearts who got married and had two daughters.\xc2\xa0 They did everything together -- traveling the open road in their RV, enjoying what their friends called a 50-year honeymoon.\xc2\xa0 Saturday morning, they went by the Safeway to hear what their congresswoman had to say.\xc2\xa0 When gunfire rang out, George, a former Marine, instinctively tried to shield his wife.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Both were shot.\xc2\xa0 Dot passed away. A New Jersey native, Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow.\xc2\xa0 But in the summer, she would return East, where her world revolved around her three children, her seven grandchildren and 2-year-old great-granddaughter.\xc2\xa0 A gifted quilter, she\xe2\x80\x99d often work under a favorite tree, or sometimes she\'d sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants -- (laughter) -- to give out at the church where she volunteered.\xc2\xa0 A Republican, she took a liking to Gabby, and wanted to get to know her better.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard grew up in Tucson together -\xe2\x80\x93 about 70 years ago.\xc2\xa0 They moved apart and started their own respective families.\xc2\xa0 But after both were widowed they found their way back here, to, as one of Mavy\xe2\x80\x99s daughters put it, \xe2\x80\x9cbe boyfriend and girlfriend again.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) When they weren\xe2\x80\x99t out on the road in their motor home, you could find them just up the road, helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ.\xc2\xa0 A retired construction worker, Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the church along with his dog, Tux.\xc2\xa0 His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife, sacrificing his life for hers.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Everything -- everything -- Gabe Zimmerman did, he did with passion.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But his true passion was helping people.\xc2\xa0 As Gabby\xe2\x80\x99s outreach director, he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own, seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned, that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved, that government was working for ordinary folks.\xc2\xa0 He died doing what he loved -\xe2\x80\x93 talking with people and seeing how he could help.\xc2\xa0 And Gabe is survived by his parents, Ross and Emily, his brother, Ben, and his fianc\xc3\xa9e, Kelly, who he planned to marry next year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And then there is nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green.\xc2\xa0 Christina was an A student; she was a dancer; she was a gymnast; she was a swimmer.\xc2\xa0 She decided that she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues, and as the only girl on her Little League team, no one put it past her.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99d remind her mother, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are so blessed.\xc2\xa0 We have the best life.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99d pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate. Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing.\xc2\xa0 Our hearts are broken -\xe2\x80\x93 and yet, our hearts also have reason for fullness.\r\nOur hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 13 Americans who survived the shooting, including the congresswoman many of them went to see on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 I have just come from the University Medical Center, just a mile from here, where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak.\xc2\xa0 And I want to tell you -- her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you -- right after we went to visit, a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room, Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Gabby opened her eyes for the first time.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Gabby opened her eyes.\xc2\xa0 Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you she knows we are here.\xc2\xa0 She knows we love her.\xc2\xa0 And she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey.\xc2\xa0 We are there for her.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Our hearts are full of thanks for that good news, and our hearts are full of gratitude for those who saved others.\xc2\xa0 We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez -- (applause) -- a volunteer in Gabby\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And, Daniel, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you may deny it, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided you are a hero because -- (applause) -- you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss, and tended to her wounds and helped keep her alive.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We are grateful to the men who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Right over there.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch, who wrestled away the killer\xe2\x80\x99s ammunition, and undoubtedly saved some lives.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And we are grateful for the doctors and nurses and first responders who worked wonders to heal those who\xe2\x80\x99d been hurt.\xc2\xa0 We are grateful to them.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle.\xc2\xa0 They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength.\xc2\xa0 Heroism is here, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, all around us, just waiting to be summoned -\xe2\x80\x93 as it was on Saturday morning. Their actions, their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us.\xc2\xa0 It raises a question of what, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward.\xc2\xa0 How can we honor the fallen?\xc2\xa0 How can we be true to their memory? You see, when a tragedy like this strikes, it is part of our nature to demand explanations \xe2\x80\x93- to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless.\xc2\xa0 Already we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a national conversation commence, not only about the motivations behind these killings, but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system.\xc2\xa0 And much of this process, of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future, is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self-government. But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized -\xe2\x80\x93 at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do -\xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking with each other in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world, and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding. In the words of Job, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I looked for light, then came darkness.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Bad things happen, and we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath. For the truth is none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack.\xc2\xa0 None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being fired, or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent man\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have to examine all the facts behind this tragedy.\xc2\xa0 We cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence.\xc2\xa0 We should be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects of such violence in the future.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That we cannot do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That we cannot do. As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility.\xc2\xa0 Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, let\xe2\x80\x99s use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family -\xe2\x80\x93 especially if the loss is unexpected.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re shaken out of our routines.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re forced to look inward.\xc2\xa0 We reflect on the past:\xc2\xa0 Did we spend enough time with an aging parent, we wonder.\xc2\xa0 Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us?\xc2\xa0 Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them, not just once in a while but every single day? So sudden loss causes us to look backward -\xe2\x80\x93 but it also forces us to look forward; to reflect on the present and the future, on the manner in which we live our lives and nurture our relationships with those who are still with us.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We may ask ourselves if we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown enough kindness and generosity and compassion to the people in our lives.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps we question whether we\'re doing right by our children, or our community, whether our priorities are in order. We recognize our own mortality, and we are reminded that in the fleeting time we have on this Earth, what matters is not wealth, or status, or power, or fame -\xe2\x80\x93 but rather, how well we have loved -- (applause)-- and what small part we have played in making the lives of other people better.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And that process -- that process of reflection, of making sure we align our values with our actions \xe2\x80\x93- that, I believe, is what a tragedy like this requires.\xc2\xa0 For those who were harmed, those who were killed \xe2\x80\x93- they are part of our family, an American family 300 million strong. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We may not have known them personally, but surely we see ourselves in them.\xc2\xa0 In George and Dot, in Dorwan and Mavy, we sense the abiding love we have for our own husbands, our own wives, our own life partners.\xc2\xa0 Phyllis \xe2\x80\x93- she\xe2\x80\x99s our mom or our grandma; Gabe our brother or son.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 In Judge Roll, we recognize not only a man who prized his family and doing his job well, but also a man who embodied America\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity to the law. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And in Gabby -- in Gabby, we see a reflection of our public-spiritedness; that desire to participate in that sometimes frustrating, sometimes contentious, but always necessary and never-ending process to form a more perfect union.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And in Christina -- in Christina we see all of our children. So curious, so trusting, so energetic, so full of magic.\xc2\xa0 So deserving of our love.\xc2\xa0 And so deserving of our good example.\xc2\xa0 If this tragedy prompts reflection and debate -- as it should -- let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of those we have lost.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the usual plane of politics and point-scoring and pettiness that drifts away in the next news cycle. The loss of these wonderful people should make every one of us strive to be better.\xc2\xa0 To be better in our private lives, to be better friends and neighbors and coworkers and parents.\xc2\xa0 And if, as has been discussed in recent days, their death helps usher in more civility in our public discourse, let us remember it is not because a simple lack of civility caused this tragedy -- it did not -- but rather because only a more civil and honest public discourse can help us face up to the challenges of our nation in a way that would make them proud.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords, who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans, and that we can question each other\xe2\x80\x99s ideas without questioning each other\xe2\x80\x99s love of country and that our task, working together, is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American Dream to future generations.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) They believed -- they believed, and I believe that we can be better.\xc2\xa0 Those who died here, those who saved life here \xe2\x80\x93- they help me believe.\xc2\xa0 We may not be able to stop all evil in the world, but I know that how we treat one another, that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely up to us.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And I believe that for all our imperfections, we are full of decency and goodness, and that the forces that divide us are not as strong as those that unite us.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) That\xe2\x80\x99s what I believe, in part because that\xe2\x80\x99s what a child like Christina Taylor Green believed.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Imagine -- imagine for a moment, here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our democracy; just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship; just starting to glimpse the fact that some day she, too, might play a part in shaping her nation\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 She had been elected to her student council.\xc2\xa0 She saw public service as something exciting and hopeful.\xc2\xa0 She was off to meet her congresswoman, someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model.\xc2\xa0 She saw all this through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted. I want to live up to her expectations.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it.\xc2\xa0 I want America to be as good as she imagined it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 All of us -\xe2\x80\x93 we should do everything we can to make sure this country lives up to our children\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) As has already been mentioned, Christina was given to us on September 11th, 2001, one of 50 babies born that day to be pictured in a book called \xe2\x80\x9cFaces of Hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 On either side of her photo in that book were simple wishes for a child\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you help those in need,\xe2\x80\x9d read one.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you know all the words to the National Anthem and sing it with your hand over your heart."\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 "I hope you jump in rain puddles.\xe2\x80\x9d If there are rain puddles in Heaven, Christina is jumping in them today.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And here on this Earth -- here on this Earth, we place our hands over our hearts, and we commit ourselves as Americans to forging a country that is forever worthy of her gentle, happy spirit. May God bless and keep those we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost in restful and eternal peace.\xc2\xa0 May He love and watch over the survivors.\xc2\xa0 And may He bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
