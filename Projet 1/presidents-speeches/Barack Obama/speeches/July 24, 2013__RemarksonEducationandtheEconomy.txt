b"Hello, Warrensburg!\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Hello, Mules!\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Hello, Jennies!\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Well, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hot.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I took off my jacket.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ve still got yours on feel free to take it off.\xc2\xa0 It is great to be back in Missouri.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be back in the Midwest.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be here at UCM.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I want to thank your outstanding president, Dr. Chuck Ambrose, for having me here today.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Give Brian a big round of applause for the introduction.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got your outstanding governor, Jay Nixon, in the house.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Your mayor, Charlie Rutt, is here.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And I brought a special guest with me who is celebrating her birthday today -- your senator, Claire McCaskill.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I figured the least I could do is give her a ride on Air Force One for her birthday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got Mules in the house.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got Jennies in the house.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got governors, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got senators, and now we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably got some very confused people watching at home, because who is Jennie?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I want to thank all the students who came out on a summer afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I know that summer is -- especially a day as pretty as today, it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to be outside.\xc2\xa0 I know classes don\xe2\x80\x99t start for a few more weeks.\xc2\xa0 You could be over on Pine Street beating the heat.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Now that I think about it, it may be good that you\xe2\x80\x99re here instead of getting into trouble.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) I\xe2\x80\x99ve just come from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, where I gave a pretty long speech on the economy.\xc2\xa0 I will not repeat the whole thing here.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But what I did want to talk about today is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about when I gave my first big speech as a senator eight years ago, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where we as a country need to go to give every American a chance to get ahead in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And UCM understands how important that is.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Just a little context here -- in the period after World War II, you had a growing middle class that was the engine of our prosperity.\xc2\xa0 The economy did well in part because everybody was participating.\xc2\xa0 And whether you owned a company, or you swept the floors of that company, or you worked anywhere in between, America offered a basic bargain:\xc2\xa0 If you work hard, then you will be rewarded with fair wages and benefits.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have the chance to buy your own home.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have the chance to save for retirement.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have the protection of decent health insurance.\xc2\xa0 But most of all, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the chance to pass on a better life to your kids.\xc2\xa0 And then what happened was that engine began to stall.\xc2\xa0 The bargain began to fray.\xc2\xa0 So technology made some jobs obsolete -- nobody goes to a bank teller anymore.\xc2\xa0 You want to schedule a trip somewhere, you get online.\xc2\xa0 Global competition sent some jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 When I was in Galesburg, we talked about the Maytag plant that used to make household brands there and people -- thousands of people used to work in the plant and it went down to Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Then Washington doled out bigger tax cuts to folks at the top income brackets, smaller minimum wage increases for people who were struggling.\xc2\xa0 You combine all this and the income of the top 1 percent quadrupled from 1979 to 2007, but the typical family\xe2\x80\x99s incomes barely budged.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of middle-class families began to feel that the odds were stacked against them -- and they were right.\xc2\xa0 And then for a while, this was kind of papered over because we had a housing bubble going on, and everybody was maxing out on their credit cards, everybody was highly leveraged, there were a lot of financial deals going around.\xc2\xa0 And so it looked like the economy was going to be doing okay, but then by the time I took office, the bottom had fallen out.\xc2\xa0 And it cost, as we know, millions of Americans their jobs or their homes or their savings.\xc2\xa0 And that long-term erosion of middle-class security was evident for everybody to see. Now, the good news is, five years later, five years after the crisis first hit, America has fought its way back.\xc2\xa0 So together, we saved an auto industry.\xc2\xa0 We took on a broken health care system.\xc2\xa0 We invested in new American technologies to reverse our addiction to foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 We doubled the production of clean energy.\xc2\xa0 Natural gas took off.\xc2\xa0 We put in place tough new rules on big banks and mortgage lenders and credit card companies.\xc2\xa0 We changed the tax code so it was fair for middle-class folks and didn't just benefit folks at the very top like me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, it's true, because things were skewed too much towards folks who were already blessed, already lucky.\xc2\xa0 And you take all that together and now you add it all up.\xc2\xa0 What we've seen is over the past 40 months, our businesses have created more than 7.2 million new jobs.\xc2\xa0 This year, we're off to our strongest private sector job growth since 1999.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Our exports have surged, so we sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from overseas, and that's the first time that's happened in nearly 20 years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years, so we're slowing the growth of health care costs.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Deficits have been cut by almost half from the time I took office. So we did this together, because Americans are gritty and resilient and work hard.\xc2\xa0 We've been able to clear away the rubble of the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 We're starting to lay a new foundation for more durable economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And with the new revolutions in energy and technology and manufacturing and health care, we're actually poised -- we're in a position to reverse all those forces that battered middle-class families for too long.\xc2\xa0 We can start building now an economy where everybody who works hard can get ahead.\xc2\xa0 That's all good.\xc2\xa0 That's the good news. But, Missouri, I\xe2\x80\x99m here to tell you what you already know, which is we're not there yet.\xc2\xa0 In some ways, the trends that have been building for decades -- this winner-take-all economy where a few do better and better, but everybody else just treads water -- all those trends were made worse by the recession.\xc2\xa0 And reversing these trends has to be Washington\xe2\x80\x99s number one priority.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It has to be Washington's number one priority.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Putting people back to work, making sure the economy is working for everybody, building the middle class, making sure they're secure -- that's my highest priority.\xc2\xa0 That's what I'm interested in.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Because when the economy is working for middle-class families, it solves an awful lot of other problems.\xc2\xa0 Now the poor start having ladders of opportunity they can climb into if they work hard.\xc2\xa0 A lot of the social tensions are reduced, because everybody is feeling pretty good.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, unfortunately, over the past couple of years in particular, Washington hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just ignored this problem -- they've actually made it worse.\xc2\xa0 And I am interested in working with everybody, and there are a bunch of not just Democrats, but also Republicans who recognize that Washington is not working.\xc2\xa0 But we've also seen a group of folks, particularly in the House, a group of Republicans in Congress that -- they suggested they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote to pay the bills that Congress had already run up.\xc2\xa0 And that fiasco harmed a fragile recovery back in 2011.\xc2\xa0 We've got a growing number of Republican senators who are trying to get things done with their Democratic counterparts -- just passed an immigration bill that economists say is going to boost our economy by more than a trillion dollars.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But so far, at least, there's a faction of House Republicans who won't let the bill go to the floor for a vote.\xc2\xa0 And if you ask them, well, okay, what's your economic agenda for the middle class, how are we going to grow our economy so everybody prospers, they'll start talking about out-of-control government spending -- although, as I said, government spending has actually gone down and deficits are going down -- or they'll talk about Obamacare, the whole idea that somehow if we don't provide health insurance to 50 million Americans that's going to improve the economy.\xc2\xa0 Never mind the fact that our jobs growth is a lot faster now than it was during the last recovery when Obamacare wasn't around. So we've got some basic challenges that we're just going to have to meet.\xc2\xa0 We've cut our deficit.\xc2\xa0 We're creating jobs at nearly twice the pace.\xc2\xa0 We are providing health care for Americans that need it.\xc2\xa0 But we now have to get back and focus on what's important.\xc2\xa0 An endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals can't get in the way of what we need to do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And I'm here to say it's got to stop.\xc2\xa0 We've got to focus on jobs and the economy, and helping middle-class families get ahead.\xc2\xa0 And if we do that, we're going to solve a whole lot of problems.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And as we're thinking about these issues, we can't get involved in short-term thinking.\xc2\xa0 We can't have all the same old debates.\xc2\xa0 That's not what the moment requires.\xc2\xa0 We've got to focus on the core economic issues that matter to you.\xc2\xa0 And as Washington is now preparing for another debate about the budget, the stakes could not be higher.\xc2\xa0 If we don't make the investments America needs to make this country a magnet for good jobs, if we don't make investments in education and manufacturing and science and research and transportation and information networks, we will be waving the white flag while other countries forge ahead in a global economy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If we just stand by and do nothing, we're saying it\xe2\x80\x99s okay for middle-class folks to keep taking it on the chin.\xc2\xa0 And I don't think it's okay.\xc2\xa0 And that's why I came here to Warrensburg today.\xc2\xa0 I need you involved in this debate to remind Washington what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.\xc2\xa0 And over the next several weeks, in towns just like this one, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to lay out my ideas for how we build on the cornerstones of what it means to be middle class, what it takes to work your way into the middle class -- a good job with good wages in durable, growing industries; a good education for our kids and our workers; a home to call your own; affordable health care that\xe2\x80\x99s there for you when you or your family members get sick -- (applause) -- a secure retirement even if you\xe2\x80\x99re not rich -- (applause) -- more ladders of opportunity for people who want to earn their way into the middle class as long as they're willing to work for it.\xc2\xa0 And what we need what we need is not a three-month plan, or even a three-year plan -- we need a long-term plan based on steady, persistent effort to reverse the forces that have conspired against middle-class families for decades.\xc2\xa0 And I am confident -- I know -- there are members of both parties who understand what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.\xc2\xa0 So I welcome ideas from anybody across the political spectrum.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in this country\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get moving.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So where I can act on my own, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wait for Congress.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Because the choices that we make now aren\xe2\x80\x99t just going to determine what happens to the young people here at this school, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to determine what happens to your kids and your grandkids.\xc2\xa0 So one thing I really want to focus on here, because UCM is doing some extraordinary things, I want to focus on just briefly that second cornerstone -- an education that prepares our kids and our workers for the global competition that you\xe2\x80\x99ll face.\xc2\xa0 That is why I wanted to highlight what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here at the University of Central Missouri, because you guys are doing some things right.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) In an age where business knows no borders, jobs are going to seek out the countries that have the most talented, skilled citizens, and those are the folks who are going to make a good living.\xc2\xa0 The days when the wages for a worker with a high-school degree could keep pace with the earnings of somebody with a college degree -- those days are over.\xc2\xa0 You can see it all throughout the Midwest, where you\xe2\x80\x99ve got folks who a generation ago could just walk into a factory or a plant, didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of skills, get trained on the job, make a good living, live out a middle-class life.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen anymore.\xc2\xa0 Technology, global competition -- those things are not going away.\xc2\xa0 So we can either throw up our hands and resign ourselves to lower living standards, or we can do what America has always done -- we can adapt, we can pull together, we can fight back, we can win.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And if we don\xe2\x80\x99t invest in American education, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put our kids, our workers, our countries, our businesses at a competitive disadvantage.\xc2\xa0 Because if you think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- if you think education is expensive, you should see how much ignorance is going to cost in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be expensive.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So what do we need to do on education?\xc2\xa0 Number one, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to start in the earliest years.\xc2\xa0 And that means working with states to make high-quality preschool available for every four-year-old in America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Every study shows this is a smart investment, encourages healthy behaviors, increases our kids\xe2\x80\x99 success in the classroom, increases their earning power as they grow up, reduces rates of teen pregnancy, reduces criminal behavior.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really important.\xc2\xa0 And any working parent will tell you that knowing your kid is in a safe place to learn is a big relief, so it\xe2\x80\x99s also important for the parents.\xc2\xa0 This idea of early childhood education, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be partisan.\xc2\xa0 States with Republican governors are doing it just like a lot of Democratic governors are doing it.\xc2\xa0 Our kids don\xe2\x80\x99t care about politics.\xc2\xa0 We should prove that we care about them and make this thing happen.\xc2\xa0 And I am going to keep on pushing, as long as I am President, until we have a situation where every kid is getting a good, healthy start in life and are prepared when they go to school.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to take action on proven ideas to upgrade our schools that don\xe2\x80\x99t require Congress.\xc2\xa0 So for example, last month, I announced a goal of connecting 99 percent of America\xe2\x80\x99s students to high-speed Internet within five years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going ahead and taking steps for that to happen right now.\xc2\xa0 Now, some of you may have gone to schools where you had internet in every classroom, but a lot of schools right now, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got maybe a computer lab, but if you go in the classroom, kids, they don\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xc2\xa0 In America, in this country, every child at every desk should have access to the entire world\xe2\x80\x99s information, and every teacher should have the cutting-edge technology to help their kids succeed and learn.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to rethink our high schools so that our kids graduate with the real-world skills that this new age demands.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to reward the schools that forge partnerships with local colleges and businesses, and that focus on the fields of the future like science and technology and math and engineering. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use the power of my office over the next few months to highlight a topic that affects probably everybody here, and that is the soaring cost of higher education.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Now, three years ago, I worked with Democrats to reform the student loan system so that taxpayer dollars weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to pad the pockets of big banks, and instead were going to help students get a college education.\xc2\xa0 So millions of students were helped by that.\xc2\xa0 We took action to cap loan repayments at 10 percent of monthly incomes for responsible borrowers.\xc2\xa0 A lot of young people don\xe2\x80\x99t know this, but if you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken out federal loans, then if you choose a job, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay as much as you\xe2\x80\x99d like or you deserve, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a teacher or some other profession, you only have to pay 10 percent of your income, which means that you can afford to go to college and know that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be broke when you graduate -- which is important.\xc2\xa0 And not enough young people are using this.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 As we speak -- and then, as we speak, we're working with both parties to reverse the doubling of student loan rates that happened a few weeks ago because Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t get its act together.\xc2\xa0 We've got to get student loan rates -- interest rates back down.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) So these are all good steps, but here's the problem -- and this is where what's happening at University of Central Missouri is so important.\xc2\xa0 We can put more and more money into student loans, we can put more and more money into grants, but if college costs keep on going up, then there's never going to be enough money.\xc2\xa0 I can keep student loan rates low, but if you're borrowing $80,000 for college, or $100,000 and you get out, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether interest rate is 3.5 or 8.5, you're still going to have trouble repaying it.\xc2\xa0 It'll take you longer to buy a house.\xc2\xa0 If you've got an idea for a business, it's going to take you longer to invest in starting your business. So we've got to do something about college costs.\xc2\xa0 Families and taxpayers can\xe2\x80\x99t just keep paying more and more into an undisciplined system.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get a better bang for our buck.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So states have to do their part by prioritizing higher education in their budgets -- (applause) -- because part of the reason tuition has been skyrocketing is colleges aren't -- state-funded colleges aren't getting as much funding, and so then tuition is going up on the backs of students and families.\xc2\xa0 But we've also got to test new ways of funding based not just on how many students enroll, but how well they do.\xc2\xa0 And colleges have to do their part by keeping costs from going up.\xc2\xa0 So here at Central Missouri, you are a laboratory for this kind of innovation.\xc2\xa0 I had a great discussion with not only the president of this university but also the superintendent of schools here, the head of the community colleges.\xc2\xa0 What's happened at UCM is you've partnered with the Lee\xe2\x80\x99s Summit School District, with the Metropolitan Community College, with local health care, engineering, energy, and infrastructure firms -- all industries that are going to drive job growth in the future -- and everybody is now working together to equip students with better skills, allow them to graduate faster with less debt, and with the certainty of being able to get a job at the other end.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That's a recipe for success over the long term. So we've got students at Summit Technology Academy -- (applause) -- there we go.\xc2\xa0 Those students, they're beginning to accrue credits towards an associate\xe2\x80\x99s degree while they\xe2\x80\x99re still in high school, which means they can come here to earn a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in two years and graduate debt free.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Debt free, on a fast track.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And because the community colleges and industries are involved, students are making quicker decisions about the industries that are going to create jobs, and the businesses are helping to design the programs to make sure that they have the skills for those jobs so that not only are you graduating debt free, but you also know that you've got a job waiting for you on the other end.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Now, that is exactly the kind of innovation we need when it comes to college costs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what's happening right here in Warrensburg.\xc2\xa0 And I want the entire country to notice it, and I want other colleges to take a look at what's being done here.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked my team to shake the trees all across the country for some of the best ideas out there for keeping college costs down, so that as students prepare to go back to school, I\xe2\x80\x99m in a position to lay out what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an aggressive strategy to shake up the system to make sure that middle-class students, working-class students, poor kids who have the drive and the wherewithal and want to get a good college education, they can get it without basically mortgaging their entire future.\xc2\xa0 We can make this happen but this is an example of the kind of thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to focus on instead of a bunch of distractions in Washington.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Tackling college costs, creating more good jobs, establishing a better bargain for middle-class families and everybody trying to work to join into it, an economy that grows not from the top down but from the middle out -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not just what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to focus on for the next few months, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be focused on for the remainder of my presidency.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take these plans all across the country, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask folks for help because, frankly, sometimes I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Congress.\xc2\xa0 It just takes them a long time to decide on stuff.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach out to CEOs and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach out to workers, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach out to college presidents and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reach out to students.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to Democrats and independents -- and, yes, I will be asking Republicans to get involved because this has to be our core project for the next decade. I want to lay out my ideas to give the middle class a better shot in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And look, I want Republicans to lay out their ideas.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better idea to bring down college costs that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought of, let\xe2\x80\x99s hear them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to go.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better plan to make sure that every American knows the security of affordable health care, then please share it with the class.\xc2\xa0 Raise your hand.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But what you can\xe2\x80\x99t do is just manufacture another crisis because you think it might be good politics, just as our economy is getting some traction.\xc2\xa0 What you can\xe2\x80\x99t do is shut down our government just because I\xe2\x80\x99m for opening the government.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t threaten not to pay the bills this country racked up or to cut investments in education and science and basic research that are going to help us grow.\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to manage deficits and debt, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it in a sensible way.\xc2\xa0 We can do this if we work together.\xc2\xa0 And it may seem hard right now, but if we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency, set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the past few years -- I promise you, our economy will be stronger a year from now, just like it\xe2\x80\x99s stronger now than it was last year.\xc2\xa0 And then it will be stronger five years from now, and then it will be stronger 10 years from now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And more Americans will have the pride of a first paycheck.\xc2\xa0 And more Americans will have the satisfaction of starting their own business and flipping that sign that says \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 More folks will have the thrill of marching across the stage to earn a diploma from a university like this, and then know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a job waiting for them when they graduate. What makes us special -- a lot of times we talk about American exceptionalism and how much we love this country, and there are so many wonderful things about our country.\xc2\xa0 But what makes us the envy of the world has not just been our ability to generate incredible wealth for a few people; it\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve given everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s who we are.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t just wanted success for ourselves; we want it for our neighbors.\xc2\xa0 We want it for our neighborhoods.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we don\xe2\x80\x99t call it Bob\xe2\x80\x99s dream or Barbara\xe2\x80\x99s dream or Barack\xe2\x80\x99s dream -- we call it the American Dream.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that we share.\xc2\xa0 That's who we are -- the idea that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, who you love, you can make it here in America if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying hard.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what a college education can be all about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what inspires your President, that\xe2\x80\x99s what inspires the faculty.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why when we see young people like you, we\xe2\x80\x99re inspired -- because you\xe2\x80\x99re an expression of that idea.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure that that continues -- not just for this generation, but for the next generation.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a hundred -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got 1,267 days left in my presidency.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to spend every minute, every second, as long as I have the privilege of being in this office, making sure that I am doing every single thing that I can so that middle-class families, working families, people who are out there struggling every single day -- that they know that that work can lead them to a better place.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that that American Dream is available for everybody, not just now, but in the future.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So thank you, Missouri.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, UCM.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mules.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jennies.\xc2\xa0 God bless you.\xc2\xa0 God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get to work.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)"
