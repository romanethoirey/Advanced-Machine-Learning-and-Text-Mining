b'Good evening.\xc2\xa0 As we speak, our nation faces a multitude of challenges.\xc2\xa0 At home, our top priority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched the lives of nearly every American.\xc2\xa0 Abroad, our brave men and women in uniform are taking the fight to al Qaeda wherever it exists.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99ve returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast to speak with you about the battle we\xe2\x80\x99re waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens. On April 20th, an explosion ripped through BP Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, about 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana.\xc2\xa0 Eleven workers lost their lives.\xc2\xa0 Seventeen others were injured.\xc2\xa0 And soon, nearly a mile beneath the surface of the ocean, oil began spewing into the water. Because there has never been a leak this size at this depth, stopping it has tested the limits of human technology.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why just after the rig sank, I assembled a team of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s best scientists and engineers to tackle this challenge -- a team led by Dr. Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist and our nation\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary of Energy.\xc2\xa0 Scientists at our national labs and experts from academia and other oil companies have also provided ideas and advice. As a result of these efforts, we\xe2\x80\x99ve directed BP to mobilize additional equipment and technology.\xc2\xa0 And in the coming weeks and days, these efforts should capture up to 90 percent of the oil leaking out of the well.\xc2\xa0 This is until the company finishes drilling a relief well later in the summer that\xe2\x80\x99s expected to stop the leak completely.\xc2\xa0 Already, this oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced.\xc2\xa0 And unlike an earthquake or a hurricane, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a single event that does its damage in a matter of minutes or days.\xc2\xa0 The millions of gallons of oil that have spilled into the Gulf of Mexico are more like an epidemic, one that we will be fighting for months and even years.\xc2\xa0 But make no mistake:\xc2\xa0 We will fight this spill with everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve got for as long as it takes.\xc2\xa0 We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused.\xc2\xa0 And we will do whatever\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.\xc2\xa0 Tonight I\xe2\x80\x99d like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward:\xc2\xa0 what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to clean up the oil, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to help our neighbors in the Gulf, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to make sure that a catastrophe like this never happens again.\xc2\xa0 First, the cleanup.\xc2\xa0 From the very beginning of this crisis, the federal government has been in charge of the largest environmental cleanup effort in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history -- an effort led by Admiral Thad Allen, who has almost 40 years of experience responding to disasters.\xc2\xa0 We now have nearly 30,000 personnel who are working across four states to contain and clean up the oil.\xc2\xa0 Thousands of ships and other vessels are responding in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve authorized the deployment of over 17,000 National Guard members along the coast.\xc2\xa0 These servicemen and women are ready to help stop the oil from coming ashore, they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to help clean the beaches, train response workers, or even help with processing claims -- and I urge the governors in the affected states to activate these troops as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 Because of our efforts, millions of gallons of oil have already been removed from the water through burning, skimming and other collection methods.\xc2\xa0 Over five and a half million feet of boom has been laid across the water to block and absorb the approaching oil.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve approved the construction of new barrier islands in Louisiana to try to stop the oil before it reaches the shore, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Alabama, Mississippi and Florida to implement creative approaches to their unique coastlines.\xc2\xa0 As the cleanup continues, we will offer whatever additional resources and assistance our coastal states may need.\xc2\xa0 Now, a mobilization of this speed and magnitude will never be perfect, and new challenges will always arise.\xc2\xa0 I saw and heard evidence of that during this trip.\xc2\xa0 So if something isn\xe2\x80\x99t working, we want to hear about it.\xc2\xa0 If there are problems in the operation, we will fix them.\xc2\xa0 But we have to recognize that despite our best efforts, oil has already caused damage to our coastline and its wildlife.\xc2\xa0 And sadly, no matter how effective our response is, there will be more oil and more damage before this siege is done.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the second thing we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is the recovery and restoration of the Gulf Coast.\xc2\xa0 You know, for generations, men and women who call this region home have made their living from the water.\xc2\xa0 That living is now in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to shrimpers and fishermen who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to support their families this year.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen empty docks and restaurants with fewer customers -\xe2\x80\x93 even in areas where the beaches are not yet affected.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to owners of shops and hotels who wonder when the tourists might start coming back.\xc2\xa0 The sadness and the anger they feel is not just about the money they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a wrenching anxiety that their way of life may be lost.\xc2\xa0 I refuse to let that happen.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, I will meet with the chairman of BP and inform him that he is to set aside whatever resources are required to compensate the workers and business owners who have been harmed as a result of his company\xe2\x80\x99s recklessness.\xc2\xa0 And this fund will not be controlled by BP.\xc2\xa0 In order to ensure that all legitimate claims are paid out in a fair and timely manner, the account must and will be administered by an independent third party.\xc2\xa0 Beyond compensating the people of the Gulf in the short term, it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear we need a long-term plan to restore the unique beauty and bounty of this region.\xc2\xa0 The oil spill represents just the latest blow to a place that\xe2\x80\x99s already suffered multiple economic disasters and decades of environmental degradation that has led to disappearing wetlands and habitats.\xc2\xa0 And the region still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t recovered from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we must make a commitment to the Gulf Coast that goes beyond responding to the crisis of the moment.\xc2\xa0 I make that commitment tonight.\xc2\xa0 Earlier, I asked Ray Mabus, the Secretary of the Navy, who is also a former governor of Mississippi and a son of the Gulf Coast, to develop a long-term Gulf Coast Restoration Plan as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 The plan will be designed by states, local communities, tribes, fishermen, businesses, conservationists and other Gulf residents.\xc2\xa0 And BP will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The third part of our response plan is the steps we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to ensure that a disaster like this does not happen again.\xc2\xa0 A few months ago, I approved a proposal to consider new, limited offshore drilling under the assurance that it would be absolutely safe \xe2\x80\x93- that the proper technology would be in place and the necessary precautions would be taken. That obviously was not the case in the Deepwater Horizon rig, and I want to know why.\xc2\xa0 The American people deserve to know why.\xc2\xa0 The families I met with last week who lost their loved ones in the explosion -- these families deserve to know why.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99ve established a National Commission to understand the causes of this disaster and offer recommendations on what additional safety and environmental standards we need to put in place.\xc2\xa0 Already, I\xe2\x80\x99ve issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling.\xc2\xa0 I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue.\xc2\xa0 And while I urge the Commission to complete its work as quickly as possible, I expect them to do that work thoroughly and impartially.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One place we\xe2\x80\x99ve already begun to take action is at the agency in charge of regulating drilling and issuing permits, known as the Minerals Management Service.\xc2\xa0 Over the last decade, this agency has become emblematic of a failed philosophy that views all regulation with hostility -- a philosophy that says corporations should be allowed to play by their own rules and police themselves.\xc2\xa0 At this agency, industry insiders were put in charge of industry oversight.\xc2\xa0 Oil companies showered regulators with gifts and favors, and were essentially allowed to conduct their own safety inspections and write their own regulations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When Ken Salazar became my Secretary of the Interior, one of his very first acts was to clean up the worst of the corruption at this agency.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s now clear that the problem there ran much deeper, and the pace of reform was just too slow.\xc2\xa0 And so Secretary Salazar and I are bringing in new leadership at the agency -- Michael Bromwich, who was a tough federal prosecutor and Inspector General.\xc2\xa0 And his charge over the next few months is to build an organization that acts as the oil industry\xe2\x80\x99s watchdog -- not its partner.\xc2\xa0 So one of the lessons we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from this spill is that we need better regulations, better safety standards, and better enforcement when it comes to offshore drilling.\xc2\xa0 But a larger lesson is that no matter how much we improve our regulation of the industry, drilling for oil these days entails greater risk.\xc2\xa0 After all, oil is a finite resource.\xc2\xa0 We consume more than 20 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil, but have less than 2 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil reserves.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the reason oil companies are drilling a mile beneath the surface of the ocean -- because we\xe2\x80\x99re running out of places to drill on land and in shallow water.\xc2\xa0 For decades, we have known the days of cheap and easily accessible oil were numbered.\xc2\xa0 For decades, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked and talked about the need to end America\xe2\x80\x99s century-long addiction to fossil fuels.\xc2\xa0 And for decades, we have failed to act with the sense of urgency that this challenge requires.\xc2\xa0 Time and again, the path forward has been blocked -- not only by oil industry lobbyists, but also by a lack of political courage and candor.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The consequences of our inaction are now in plain sight.\xc2\xa0 Countries like China are investing in clean energy jobs and industries that should be right here in America.\xc2\xa0 Each day, we send nearly $1 billion of our wealth to foreign countries for their oil.\xc2\xa0 And today, as we look to the Gulf, we see an entire way of life being threatened by a menacing cloud of black crude. We cannot consign our children to this future.\xc2\xa0 The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now.\xc2\xa0 Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash America\xe2\x80\x99s innovation and seize control of our own destiny. This is not some distant vision for America.\xc2\xa0 The transition away from fossil fuels is going to take some time, but over the last year and a half, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken unprecedented action to jumpstart the clean energy industry.\xc2\xa0 As we speak, old factories are reopening to produce wind turbines, people are going back to work installing energy-efficient windows, and small businesses are making solar panels.\xc2\xa0 Consumers are buying more efficient cars and trucks, and families are making their homes more energy-efficient.\xc2\xa0 Scientists and researchers are discovering clean energy technologies that someday will lead to entire new industries.\xc2\xa0 Each of us has a part to play in a new future that will benefit all of us.\xc2\xa0 As we recover from this recession, the transition to clean energy has the potential to grow our economy and create millions of jobs -\xe2\x80\x93 but only if we accelerate that transition.\xc2\xa0 Only if we seize the moment.\xc2\xa0 And only if we rally together and act as one nation \xe2\x80\x93- workers and entrepreneurs; scientists and citizens; the public and private sectors.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nWhen I was a candidate for this office, I laid out a set of principles that would move our country towards energy independence.\xc2\xa0 Last year, the House of Representatives acted on these principles by passing a strong and comprehensive energy and climate bill \xe2\x80\x93- a bill that finally makes clean energy the profitable kind of energy for America\xe2\x80\x99s businesses.\xc2\xa0 Now, there are costs associated with this transition.\xc2\xa0 And there are some who believe that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford those costs right now.\xc2\xa0 I say we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford not to change how we produce and use energy -\xe2\x80\x93 because the long-term costs to our economy, our national security, and our environment are far greater.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look at other ideas and approaches from either party -\xe2\x80\x93 as long they seriously tackle our addiction to fossil fuels.\xc2\xa0 Some have suggested raising efficiency standards in our buildings like we did in our cars and trucks.\xc2\xa0 Some believe we should set standards to ensure that more of our electricity comes from wind and solar power.\xc2\xa0 Others wonder why the energy industry only spends a fraction of what the high-tech industry does on research and development -\xe2\x80\x93 and want to rapidly boost our investments in such research and development.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of these approaches have merit, and deserve a fair hearing in the months ahead.\xc2\xa0 But the one approach I will not accept is inaction.\xc2\xa0 The one answer I will not settle for is the idea that this challenge is somehow too big and too difficult to meet.\xc2\xa0 You know, the same thing was said about our ability to produce enough planes and tanks in World War II.\xc2\xa0 The same thing was said about our ability to harness the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon.\xc2\xa0 And yet, time and again, we have refused to settle for the paltry limits of conventional wisdom.\xc2\xa0 Instead, what has defined us as a nation since our founding is the capacity to shape our destiny -\xe2\x80\x93 our determination to fight for the America we want for our children.\xc2\xa0 Even if we\xe2\x80\x99re unsure exactly what that looks like.\xc2\xa0 Even if we don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know precisely how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get there.\xc2\xa0 We know we\xe2\x80\x99ll get there.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a faith in the future that sustains us as a people.\xc2\xa0 It is that same faith that sustains our neighbors in the Gulf right now.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Each year, at the beginning of shrimping season, the region\xe2\x80\x99s fishermen take part in a tradition that was brought to America long ago by fishing immigrants from Europe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Blessing of the Fleet,\xe2\x80\x9d and today it\xe2\x80\x99s a celebration where clergy from different religions gather to say a prayer for the safety and success of the men and women who will soon head out to sea -\xe2\x80\x93 some for weeks at a time.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nThe ceremony goes on in good times and in bad.\xc2\xa0 It took place after Katrina, and it took place a few weeks ago \xe2\x80\x93- at the beginning of the most difficult season these fishermen have ever faced.\xc2\xa0 And still, they came and they prayed.\xc2\xa0 For as a priest and former fisherman once said of the tradition, \xe2\x80\x9cThe blessing is not that God has promised to remove all obstacles and dangers.\xc2\xa0 The blessing is that He is with us always,\xe2\x80\x9d a blessing that\xe2\x80\x99s granted \xe2\x80\x9ceven in the midst of the storm.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The oil spill is not the last crisis America will face.\xc2\xa0 This nation has known hard times before and we will surely know them again.\xc2\xa0 What sees us through -\xe2\x80\x93 what has always seen us through \xe2\x80\x93- is our strength, our resilience, and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it. Tonight, we pray for that courage.\xc2\xa0 We pray for the people of the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And we pray that a hand may guide us through the storm towards a brighter day.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.'
