b'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Today in America, a teacher spent extra time with a student who needed it, and did her part to lift America\xe2\x80\x99s graduation rate to its highest level in more than three decades. An entrepreneur flipped on the lights in her tech startup, and did her part to add to the more than eight million new jobs our businesses have created over the past four years.\xc2\xa0 An autoworker fine-tuned some of the best, most fuel-efficient cars in the world, and did his part to help America wean itself off foreign oil. A farmer prepared for the spring after the strongest five-year stretch of farm exports in our history.\xc2\xa0 A rural doctor gave a young child the first prescription to treat asthma that his mother could afford.\xc2\xa0 A man took the bus home from the graveyard shift, bone-tired but dreaming big dreams for his son.\xc2\xa0 And in tight-knit communities across America, fathers and mothers will tuck in their kids, put an arm around their spouse, remember fallen comrades, and give thanks for being home from a war that, after twelve long years, is finally coming to an end. Tonight, this chamber speaks with one voice to the people we represent: it is you, our citizens, who make the state of our union strong. \xc2\xa0Here are the results of your efforts:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lowest unemployment rate in over five years.\xc2\xa0 A rebounding housing market.\xc2\xa0 A manufacturing sector that\xe2\x80\x99s adding jobs for the first time since the 1990s.\xc2\xa0 More oil produced at home than we buy from the rest of the world \xe2\x80\x93 the first time that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in nearly twenty years.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our deficits \xe2\x80\x93 cut by more than half.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And for the first time in over a decade, business leaders around the world have declared that China is no longer the world\xe2\x80\x99s number one place to invest; America is. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I believe this can be a breakthrough year for America.\xc2\xa0 After five years of grit and determined effort, the United States is better-positioned for the 21st century than any other nation on Earth. The question for everyone in this chamber, running through every decision we make this year, is whether we are going to help or hinder this progress.\xc2\xa0 For several years now, this town has been consumed by a rancorous argument over the proper size of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important debate \xe2\x80\x93 one that dates back to our very founding.\xc2\xa0 But when that debate prevents us from carrying out even the most basic functions of our democracy \xe2\x80\x93 when our differences shut down government or threaten the full faith and credit of the United States \xe2\x80\x93 then we are not doing right by the American people. As President, I\xe2\x80\x99m committed to making Washington work better, and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here.\xc2\xa0 I believe most of you are, too.\xc2\xa0 Last month, thanks to the work of Democrats and Republicans, this Congress finally produced a budget that undoes some of last year\xe2\x80\x99s severe cuts to priorities like education.\xc2\xa0 Nobody got everything they wanted, and we can still do more to invest in this country\xe2\x80\x99s future while bringing down our deficit in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 But the budget compromise should leave us freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creating new crises. In the coming months, let\xe2\x80\x99s see where else we can make progress together.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s make this a year of action.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what most Americans want \xe2\x80\x93 for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.\xc2\xa0 And what I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief in opportunity for all \xe2\x80\x93 the notion that if you work hard and take responsibility, you can get ahead. Let\xe2\x80\x99s face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.\xc2\xa0 Over more than three decades, even before the Great Recession hit, massive shifts in technology and global competition had eliminated a lot of good, middle-class jobs, and weakened the economic foundations that families depend on. Today, after four years of economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices have rarely been higher, and those at the top have never done better.\xc2\xa0 But average wages have barely budged.\xc2\xa0 Inequality has deepened.\xc2\xa0 Upward mobility has stalled.\xc2\xa0 The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many Americans are working more than ever just to get by \xe2\x80\x93 let alone get ahead.\xc2\xa0 And too many still aren\xe2\x80\x99t working at all. Our job is to reverse these trends.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t happen right away, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t agree on everything.\xc2\xa0 But what I offer tonight is a set of concrete, practical proposals to speed up growth, strengthen the middle class, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Some require Congressional action, and I\xe2\x80\x99m eager to work with all of you.\xc2\xa0 But America does not stand still \xe2\x80\x93 and neither will I.\xc2\xa0 So wherever and whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do.\xc2\xa0 As usual, our First Lady sets a good example.\xc2\xa0 Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s Let\xe2\x80\x99s Move partnership with schools, businesses, and local leaders has helped bring down childhood obesity rates for the first time in thirty years \xe2\x80\x93 an achievement that will improve lives and reduce health care costs for decades to come.\xc2\xa0 The Joining Forces alliance that Michelle and Jill Biden launched has already encouraged employers to hire or train nearly 400,000 veterans and military spouses.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking a page from that playbook, the White House just organized a College Opportunity Summit where already, 150 universities, businesses, and nonprofits have made concrete commitments to reduce inequality in access to higher education \xe2\x80\x93 and help every hardworking kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.\xc2\xa0 Across the country, we\xe2\x80\x99re partnering with mayors, governors, and state legislatures on issues from homelessness to marriage equality. The point is, there are millions of Americans outside Washington who are tired of stale political arguments, and are moving this country forward.\xc2\xa0 They believe, and I believe, that here in America, our success should depend not on accident of birth, but the strength of our work ethic and the scope of our dreams.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what drew our forebears here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s how the daughter of a factory worker is CEO of America\xe2\x80\x99s largest automaker;\xc2\xa0how the son of a barkeeper is Speaker of the House; how the son of a single mom can be President of the greatest nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 Opportunity is who we are.\xc2\xa0 And the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise. We know where to start: the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job.\xc2\xa0 With the economy picking up speed, companies say they intend to hire more people this year.\xc2\xa0 And over half of big manufacturers say they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad. So let\xe2\x80\x99s make that decision easier for more companies.\xc2\xa0 Both Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s flip that equation.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home. Moreover, we can take the money we save with this transition to tax reform to create jobs rebuilding our roads, upgrading our ports, unclogging our commutes \xe2\x80\x93 because in today\xe2\x80\x99s global economy, first-class jobs gravitate to first-class infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll need Congress to protect more than three million jobs by finishing transportation and waterways bills this summer.\xc2\xa0 But I will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects, so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible. We also have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs.\xc2\xa0 My administration has launched two hubs for high-tech manufacturing in Raleigh and Youngstown, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve connected businesses to research universities that can help America lead the world in advanced technologies.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing we\xe2\x80\x99ll launch six more this year.\xc2\xa0 Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create.\xc2\xa0 So get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do more to help the entrepreneurs and small business owners who create most new jobs in America.\xc2\xa0 Over the past five years, my administration has made more loans to small business owners than any other.\xc2\xa0 And when ninety-eight percent of our exporters are small businesses, new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create more jobs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need to work together on tools like bipartisan trade promotion authority to protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped \xe2\x80\x9cMade in the USA.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 China and Europe aren\xe2\x80\x99t standing on the sidelines.\xc2\xa0 Neither should we. We know that the nation that goes all-in on innovation today will own the global economy tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 This is an edge America cannot surrender.\xc2\xa0 Federally-funded research helped lead to the ideas and inventions behind Google and smartphones.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why Congress should undo the damage done by last year\xe2\x80\x99s cuts to basic research so we can unleash the next great American discovery \xe2\x80\x93 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s vaccines that stay ahead of drug-resistant bacteria, or paper-thin material that\xe2\x80\x99s stronger than steel.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s pass a patent reform bill that allows our businesses to stay focused on innovation, not costly, needless litigation. Now, one of the biggest factors in bringing more jobs back is our commitment to American energy.\xc2\xa0 The all-of-the-above energy strategy I announced a few years ago is working, and today, America is closer to energy independence than we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in decades. One of the reasons why is natural gas \xe2\x80\x93 if extracted safely, it\xe2\x80\x99s the bridge fuel that can power our economy with less of the carbon pollution that causes climate change.\xc2\xa0 Businesses plan to invest almost $100 billion in new factories that use natural gas.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built, and this Congress can help by putting people to work building fueling stations that shift more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American natural gas.\xc2\xa0 My administration will keep working with the industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And while we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just oil and natural gas production that\xe2\x80\x99s booming; we\xe2\x80\x99re becoming a global leader in solar, too.\xc2\xa0 Every four minutes, another American home or business goes solar; every panel pounded into place by a worker whose job can\xe2\x80\x99t be outsourced.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don\xe2\x80\x99t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do. And even as we\xe2\x80\x99ve increased energy production, we\xe2\x80\x99ve partnered with businesses, builders, and local communities to reduce the energy we consume.\xc2\xa0 When we rescued our automakers, for example, we worked with them to set higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the coming months, I\xe2\x80\x99ll build on that success by setting new standards for our trucks, so we can keep driving down oil imports and what we pay at the pump. Taken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet. \xc2\xa0Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 But we have to act with more urgency \xe2\x80\x93 because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods.\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why I directed my administration to work with states, utilities, and others to set new standards on the amount of carbon pollution our power plants are allowed to dump into the air.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The shift to a cleaner energy economy won\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way.\xc2\xa0 But the debate is settled.\xc2\xa0 Climate change is a fact.\xc2\xa0 And when our children\xe2\x80\x99s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to sayyes, we did. Finally, if we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement \xe2\x80\x93 and fix our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have acted.\xc2\xa0 I know that members of both parties in the House want to do the same.\xc2\xa0 Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost $1 trillion in the next two decades.\xc2\xa0 And for good reason: when people come here to fulfill their dreams \xe2\x80\x93 to study, invent, and contribute to our culture \xe2\x80\x93 they make our country a more attractive place for businesses to locate and create jobs for everyone.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s get immigration reform done this year. The ideas I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined so far can speed up growth and create more jobs.\xc2\xa0 But in this rapidly-changing economy, we have to make sure that every American has the skills to fill those jobs. The good news is, we know how to do it.\xc2\xa0 Two years ago, as the auto industry came roaring back, Andra Rush opened up a manufacturing firm in Detroit.\xc2\xa0 She knew that Ford needed parts for the best-selling truck in America, and she knew how to make them.\xc2\xa0 She just needed the workforce.\xc2\xa0 So she dialed up what we call an American Job Center \xe2\x80\x93 places where folks can walk in to get the help or training they need to find a new job, or better job.\xc2\xa0 She was flooded with new workers.\xc2\xa0 And today, Detroit Manufacturing Systems has more than 700 employees. What Andra and her employees experienced is how it should be for every employer \xe2\x80\x93 and every job seeker.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked Vice President Biden to lead an across-the-board reform of America\xe2\x80\x99s training programs to make sure they have one mission: train Americans with the skills employers need, and match them to good jobs that need to be filled right now.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That means more on-the-job training, and more apprenticeships that set a young worker on an upward trajectory for life.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It means connecting companies to community colleges that can help design training to fill their specific needs.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress wants to help, you can concentrate funding on proven programs that connect more ready-to-work Americans with ready-to-be-filled jobs. I\xe2\x80\x99m also convinced we can help Americans return to the workforce faster by reforming unemployment insurance so that it\xe2\x80\x99s more effective in today\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0 But first, this Congress needs to restore the unemployment insurance you just let expire for 1.6 million people. Let me tell you why. Misty DeMars is a mother of two young boys.\xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99d been steadily employed since she was a teenager.\xc2\xa0 She put herself through college.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99d never collected unemployment benefits.\xc2\xa0 In May, she and her husband used their life savings to buy their first home.\xc2\xa0 A week later, budget cuts claimed the job she loved.\xc2\xa0 Last month, when their unemployment insurance was cut off, she sat down and wrote me a letter \xe2\x80\x93 the kind I get every day.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the face of the unemployment crisis,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI am not dependent on the government\xe2\x80\xa6Our country depends on people like us who build careers, contribute to society\xe2\x80\xa6care about our neighbors\xe2\x80\xa6I am confident that in time I will find a job\xe2\x80\xa6I will pay my taxes, and we will raise our children in their own home in the community we love.\xc2\xa0 Please give us this chance.\xe2\x80\x9d Congress, give these hardworking, responsible Americans that chance.\xc2\xa0 They need our help, but more important, this country needs them in the game.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking CEOs to give more long-term unemployed workers a fair shot at that new job and new chance to support their families; this week, many will come to the White House to make that commitment real.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tonight, I ask every business leader in America to join us and to do the same \xe2\x80\x93 because we are stronger when America fields a full team.\xc2\xa0 Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to train today\xe2\x80\x99s workforce.\xc2\xa0 We also have to prepare tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s workforce, by guaranteeing every child access to a world-class education. Estiven Rodriguez couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak a word of English when he moved to New York City at age nine.\xc2\xa0 But last month, thanks to the support of great teachers and an innovative tutoring program, he led a march of his classmates \xe2\x80\x93 through a crowd of cheering parents and neighbors \xe2\x80\x93 from their high school to the post office, where they mailed off their college applications.\xc2\xa0 And this son of a factory worker just found out he\xe2\x80\x99s going to college this fall. Five years ago, we set out to change the odds for all our kids.\xc2\xa0 We worked with lenders to reform student loans, and today, more young people are earning college degrees than ever before.\xc2\xa0 Race to the Top, with the help of governors from both parties, has helped states raise expectations and performance.\xc2\xa0 Teachers and principals in schools from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. are making big strides in preparing students with skills for the new economy \xe2\x80\x93 problem solving, critical thinking, science, technology, engineering, and math.\xc2\xa0 Some of this change is hard.\xc2\xa0 It requires everything from more challenging curriculums and more demanding parents to better support for teachers and new ways to measure how well our kids think, not how well they can fill in a bubble on a test.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s worth it \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s working.\xc2\xa0 The problem is we\xe2\x80\x99re still not reaching enough kids, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not reaching them in time.\xc2\xa0 That has to change.\xc2\xa0 Research shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child\xe2\x80\x99s life is high-quality early education.\xc2\xa0 Last year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old.\xc2\xa0 As a parent as well as a President, I repeat that request tonight.\xc2\xa0But in the meantime, thirty states have raised pre-k funding on their own.\xc2\xa0 They know we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.\xc2\xa0 So just as we worked with states to reform our schools, this year, we\xe2\x80\x99ll invest in new partnerships with states and communities across the country in a race to the top for our youngest children.\xc2\xa0 And as Congress decides what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to do, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to pull together a coalition of elected officials, business leaders, and philanthropists willing to help more kids access the high-quality pre-K they need. Last year, I also pledged to connect 99 percent of our students to high-speed broadband over the next four years.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tonight, I can announce that with the support of the FCC and companies like Apple, Microsoft, Sprint, and Verizon, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a down payment to start connecting more than 15,000 schools and twenty million students over the next two years, without adding a dime to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working to redesign high schools and partner them with colleges and employers that offer the real-world education and hands-on training that can lead directly to a job and career.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re shaking up our system of higher education to give parents more information, and colleges more incentives to offer better value, so that no middle-class kid is priced out of a college education.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re offering millions the opportunity to cap their monthly student loan payments to ten percent of their income, and I want to work with Congress to see how we can help even more Americans who feel trapped by student loan debt.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m reaching out to some of America\xe2\x80\x99s leading foundations and corporations on\xc2\xa0a new initiativeto help more young men of color facing tough odds stay on track and reach their full potential. The bottom line is, Michelle and I want every child to have the same chance this country gave us.\xc2\xa0 But we know our opportunity agenda won\xe2\x80\x99t be complete \xe2\x80\x93 and too many young people entering the workforce today will see the American Dream as an empty promise \xe2\x80\x93 unless we do more to make sure our economy honors the dignity of work, and hard work pays off for every single American.\xc2\xa0 Today, women make up about half our workforce.\xc2\xa0 But they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns.\xc2\xa0 That is wrong, and in 2014, it\xe2\x80\x99s an embarrassment. A woman deserves equal pay for equal work.\xc2\xa0 She deserves to have a baby without sacrificing her job.\xc2\xa0 A mother deserves a day off to care for a sick child or sick parent without running into hardship \xe2\x80\x93 and you know what, a father does, too.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a \xe2\x80\x9cMad Men\xe2\x80\x9d episode.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This year, let\xe2\x80\x99s all come together \xe2\x80\x93 Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street \xe2\x80\x93 to give every woman the opportunity she deserves.\xc2\xa0 Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds. Now, women hold a majority of lower-wage jobs \xe2\x80\x93 but they\xe2\x80\x99re not the only ones stifled by stagnant wages.\xc2\xa0 Americans understand that some people will earn more than others, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t resent those who, by virtue of their efforts, achieve incredible success.\xc2\xa0 But Americans overwhelmingly agree that no one who works full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty. In the year since I asked this Congress to raise the minimum wage, five states have passed laws to raise theirs.\xc2\xa0 Many businesses have done it on their own.\xc2\xa0 Nick Chute is here tonight with his boss, John Soranno.\xc2\xa0 John\xe2\x80\x99s an owner of Punch Pizza in Minneapolis, and Nick helps make the dough.\xc2\xa0 Only now he makes more of it: John just gave his employees a raise, to ten bucks an hour \xe2\x80\x93 a decision that eased their financial stress and boosted their morale. Tonight, I ask more of America\xe2\x80\x99s business leaders to follow John\xe2\x80\x99s lead and do what you can to raise your employees\xe2\x80\x99 wages.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To every mayor, governor, and state legislator in America, I say, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait for Congress to act; Americans will support you if you take this on.\xc2\xa0 And as a chief executive, I intend to lead by example. Profitable corporations like Costco see higher wages as the smart way to boost productivity and reduce turnover. We should too.\xc2\xa0 In the coming weeks, I will issue an Executive Order requiring federal contractors to pay their federally-funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour \xe2\x80\x93 because if you cook our troops\xe2\x80\x99 meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to live in poverty. Of course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board. Today, the federal minimum wage is worth about twenty percent less than it was when Ronald Reagan first stood here.\xc2\xa0 Tom Harkin and George Miller have a bill to fix that by lifting the minimum wage to $10.10.\xc2\xa0 This will help families.\xc2\xa0 It will give businesses customers with more money to spend.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve any new bureaucratic program.\xc2\xa0 So join the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 Say yes.\xc2\xa0 Give America a raise. There are other steps we can take to help families make ends meet, and few are more effective at reducing inequality and helping families pull themselves up through hard work than the Earned Income Tax Credit.\xc2\xa0 Right now, it helps about half of all parents at some point.\xc2\xa0 But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough for single workers who don\xe2\x80\x99t have kids.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead. Let\xe2\x80\x99s do more to help Americans save for retirement. Today, most workers don\xe2\x80\x99t have a pension.\xc2\xa0 A Social Security check often isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough on its own.\xc2\xa0 And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help folks who don\xe2\x80\x99t have 401ks.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg.\xc2\xa0 MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.\xc2\xa0 And if this Congress wants to help, work with me to fix an upside-down tax code that gives big tax breaks to help the wealthy save, but does little to nothing for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 Offer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.\xc2\xa0 And since the most important investment many families make is their home, send me legislation that protects taxpayers from footing the bill for a housing crisis ever again, and keeps the dream of homeownership alive for future generations of Americans. One last point on financial security.\xc2\xa0 For decades, few things exposed hard-working families to economic hardship more than a broken health care system.\xc2\xa0 And in case you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of fixing that. A pre-existing condition used to mean that someone like Amanda Shelley, a physician assistant and single mom from Arizona, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get health insurance.\xc2\xa0 But on January 1st, she got covered.\xc2\xa0 On January 3rd, she felt a sharp pain.\xc2\xa0 On January 6th, she had emergency surgery.\xc2\xa0 Just one week earlier, Amanda said, that surgery would\xe2\x80\x99ve meant bankruptcy. That\xe2\x80\x99s what health insurance reform is all about \xe2\x80\x93 the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to lose everything.\xc2\xa0 Already, because of the Affordable Care Act, more than three million Americans under age 26 have gained coverage under their parents\xe2\x80\x99 plans. More than nine million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage. And here\xe2\x80\x99s another number: zero.\xc2\xa0 Because of this law, no American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain, or cancer. No woman can ever be charged more just because she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman.\xc2\xa0 And we did all this while adding years to Medicare\xe2\x80\x99s finances, keeping Medicare premiums flat, and lowering prescription costs for millions of seniors. Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law.\xc2\xa0 But I know that the American people aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in refighting old battles.\xc2\xa0 So again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice \xe2\x80\x93 tell America what you\xe2\x80\x99d do differently.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if the numbers add up.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that\xe2\x80\x99s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda.\xc2\xa0 The first forty were plenty.\xc2\xa0 We got it.\xc2\xa0 We all owe it to the American people to say what we\xe2\x80\x99re for, not just what we\xe2\x80\x99re against.\xc2\xa0 And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Governor Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who\xe2\x80\x99s here tonight.\xc2\xa0 Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s not the most liberal part of the country, but he\xe2\x80\x99s like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s families.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThey are our friends and neighbors,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThey are people we shop and go to church with\xe2\x80\xa6farmers out on the tractors\xe2\x80\xa6grocery clerks\xe2\x80\xa6they are people who go to work every morning praying they don\xe2\x80\x99t get sick.\xc2\xa0 No one deserves to live that way.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Steve\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st.\xc2\xa0 Moms, get on your kids to sign up.\xc2\xa0 Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application.\xc2\xa0 It will give her some peace of mind \xe2\x80\x93 plus, she\xe2\x80\x99ll appreciate hearing from you.\xc2\xa0 After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit of citizenship \xe2\x80\x93 the recognition that through hard work and responsibility, we can pursue our individual dreams, but still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation can pursue its dreams as well. Citizenship means standing up for everyone\xe2\x80\x99s right to vote.\xc2\xa0 Last year, part of the Voting Rights Act was weakened.\xc2\xa0 But conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are working together to strengthen it; and the bipartisan commission I appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s support these efforts.\xc2\xa0 It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy. Citizenship means standing up for the lives that gun violence steals from us each day.\xc2\xa0 I have seen the courage of parents, students, pastors, and police officers all over this country who say \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d and I intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook. Citizenship demands a sense of common cause; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.\xc2\xa0 And I know this chamber agrees that few Americans give more to their country than our diplomats and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. Tonight, because of the extraordinary troops and civilians who risk and lay down their lives to keep us free, the United States is more secure.\xc2\xa0 When I took office, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Today, all our troops are out of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 More than 60,000 of our troops have already come home from Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 With Afghan forces now in the lead for their own security, our troops have moved to a support role.\xc2\xa0Together with our allies, we will complete our mission there by the end of this year, and America\xe2\x80\x99s longest war will finally be over. After 2014, we will support a unified Afghanistan as it takes responsibility for its own future.\xc2\xa0 If the Afghan government signs a security agreement that we have negotiated, a small force of Americans could remain in Afghanistan with NATO allies to carry out two narrow missions: training and assisting Afghan forces, and counterterrorism operations to pursue any remnants of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 For while our relationship with Afghanistan will change, one thing will not: our resolve that terrorists do not launch attacks against our country. The fact is, that danger remains.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While we have put al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s core leadership on a path to defeat, the threat has evolved, as al Qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world.\xc2\xa0In Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, and Mali, we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks.\xc2\xa0In Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99ll support the opposition that rejects\xc2\xa0 the agenda of terrorist networks.\xc2\xa0Here at home, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep strengthening our defenses, and combat new threats like cyberattacks.\xc2\xa0 And as we reform our defense budget, we have to keep faith with our men and women in uniform, and invest in the capabilities they need to succeed in future missions. We have to remain vigilant.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I strongly believe our leadership and our security cannot depend on our military alone.\xc2\xa0As Commander-in-Chief, I have used force when needed to protect the American people, and I will never hesitate to do so as long as I hold this office.\xc2\xa0 But I will not send our troops into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way unless it\xe2\x80\x99s truly necessary; nor will I allow our sons and daughters to be mired in open-ended conflicts.\xc2\xa0 We must fight the battles that need to be fought, not those that terrorists prefer from us \xe2\x80\x93 large-scale deployments that drain our strength and may ultimately feed extremism. So, even as we aggressively pursue terrorist networks \xe2\x80\x93 through more targeted efforts and by building the capacity of our foreign partners \xe2\x80\x93 America must move off a permanent war footing.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve imposed prudent limits on the use of drones \xe2\x80\x93 for we will not be safer if people abroad believe we strike within their countries without regard for the consequence.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs \xe2\x80\x93 because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated.\xc2\xa0 And with the Afghan war ending,\xc2\xa0this needs to be the year Congress lifts the remaining restrictions on detainee transfers and we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay \xe2\x80\x93 because we counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action, but by remaining true to our Constitutional ideals, and setting an example for the rest of the world. You see, in a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power \xe2\x80\x93 including strong and principled diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 American diplomacy has rallied more than fifty countries to prevent nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands, and allowed us to reduce our own reliance on Cold War stockpiles.\xc2\xa0 American diplomacy, backed by the threat of force, is why Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons are being eliminated, and we will continue to work with the international community to usher in the future the Syrian people deserve \xe2\x80\x93 a future free of dictatorship, terror and fear. As we speak, American diplomacy is supporting Israelis and Palestinians as they engage in difficult but necessary talks to end the conflict there; to achieve dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel \xe2\x80\x93 a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side. And it is American diplomacy, backed by pressure, that has halted the progress of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program \xe2\x80\x93 and rolled parts of that program back \xe2\x80\x93 for the very first time in a decade.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we gather here tonight, Iran has begun to eliminate its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium.\xc2\xa0 It is not installing advanced centrifuges.\xc2\xa0 Unprecedented inspections help the world verify, every day, that Iran is not building a bomb.\xc2\xa0 And with our allies and partners, we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in negotiations to see if we can peacefully achieve a goal we all share: preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. These negotiations will be difficult.\xc2\xa0 They may not succeed.\xc2\xa0 We are clear-eyed about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, which threaten our allies; and the mistrust between our nations cannot be wished away.\xc2\xa0 But these negotiations do not rely on trust; any long-term deal we agree to must be based on verifiable action that convinces us and the international community that Iran is not building a nuclear bomb.\xc2\xa0 If John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan could negotiate with the Soviet Union, then surely a strong and confident America can negotiate with less powerful adversaries today. The sanctions that we put in place helped make this opportunity possible.\xc2\xa0 But let me be clear: if this Congress sends me a new sanctions bill now that threatens to derail these talks, I will veto it.\xc2\xa0 For the sake of our national security, we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed.\xc2\xa0 If Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders do not seize this opportunity, then I will be the first to call for more sanctions, and stand ready to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But if Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders do seize the chance, then Iran could take an important step to rejoin the community of nations, and we will have resolved one of the leading security challenges of our time without the risks of war. Finally, let\xe2\x80\x99s remember that our leadership is defined not just by our defense against threats, but by the enormous opportunities to do good and promote understanding around the globe \xe2\x80\x93 to forge greater cooperation, to expand new markets, to free people from fear and want.\xc2\xa0 And no one is better positioned to take advantage of those opportunities than America.\xc2\xa0 Our alliance with Europe remains the strongest the world has ever known.\xc2\xa0 From Tunisia to Burma, we\xe2\x80\x99re supporting those who are willing to do the hard work of building democracy.\xc2\xa0 In Ukraine, we stand for the principle that all people have the right to express themselves freely and peacefully, and have a say in their country\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 Across Africa, we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing together businesses and governments to double access to electricity and help end extreme poverty.\xc2\xa0 In the Americas, we are building new ties of commerce, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also expanding cultural and educational exchanges among young people.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to focus on the Asia-Pacific, where we support our allies, shape a future of greater security and prosperity, and extend a hand to those devastated by disaster \xe2\x80\x93 as we did in the Philippines, when our Marines and civilians rushed to aid those battered by a typhoon, and were greeted with words like, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will never forget your kindness\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless America!\xe2\x80\x9d We do these things because they help promote our long-term security.\xc2\xa0 And we do them because we believe in the inherent dignity and equality of every human being, regardless of race or religion, creed or sexual orientation.\xc2\xa0 And next week, the world will see one expression of that commitment \xe2\x80\x93 when Team USA marches the red, white, and blue into the Olympic Stadium \xe2\x80\x93 and brings home the gold. My fellow Americans, no other country in the world does what we do.\xc2\xa0 On every issue, the world turns to us, not simply because of the size of our economy or our military might \xe2\x80\x93 but because of the ideals we stand for, and the burdens we bear to advance them. No one knows this better than those who serve in uniform.\xc2\xa0 As this time of war draws to a close, a new generation of heroes returns to civilian life.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep slashing that backlog so our veterans receive the benefits they\xe2\x80\x99ve earned, and our wounded warriors receive the health care \xe2\x80\x93 including the mental health care \xe2\x80\x93 that they need.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep working to help all our veterans translate their skills and leadership into jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0 And we all continue to join forces to honor and support our remarkable military families. Let me tell you about one of those families I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to know. I first met Cory Remsburg, a proud Army Ranger, at Omaha Beach on the 65th anniversary of D-Day.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Along with some of his fellow Rangers, he walked me through the program \xe2\x80\x93 a strong, impressive young man, with an easy manner, sharp as a tack.\xc2\xa0 We joked around, and took pictures, and I told him to stay in touch. A few months later, on his tenth deployment, Cory was nearly killed by a massive roadside bomb in Afghanistan. His comrades found him in a canal, face down, underwater, shrapnel in his brain.\xc2\xa0 For months, he lay in a coma.\xc2\xa0 The next time I met him, in the hospital, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t speak; he could barely move.\xc2\xa0 Over the years, he\xe2\x80\x99s endured dozens of surgeries and procedures, and hours of grueling rehab every day.\xc2\xa0 Even now, Cory is still blind in one eye.\xc2\xa0 He still struggles on his left side.\xc2\xa0 But slowly, steadily, with the support of caregivers like his dad Craig, and the community around him, Cory has grown stronger. Day by day, he\xe2\x80\x99s learned to speak again and stand again and walk again \xe2\x80\x93 and he\xe2\x80\x99s working toward the day when he can serve his country again.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cMy recovery has not been easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in life that\xe2\x80\x99s worth anything is easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Cory is here tonight.\xc2\xa0 And like the Army he loves, like the America he serves, Sergeant First Class Cory Remsburg never gives up, and he does not quit.\xc2\xa0 My fellow Americans, men and women like Cory remind us that America has never come easy.\xc2\xa0 Our freedom, our democracy, has never been easy.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes we stumble; we make mistakes; we get frustrated or discouraged.\xc2\xa0 But for more than two hundred years, we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress \xe2\x80\x93 to create and build and expand the possibilities of individual achievement; to free other nations from tyranny and fear; to promote justice, and fairness, and equality under the law, so that the words set to paper by our founders are made real for every citizen.\xc2\xa0 The America we want for our kids \xe2\x80\x93 a rising America where honest work is plentiful and communities are strong; where prosperity is widely shared and opportunity for all lets us go as far as our dreams and toil will take us \xe2\x80\x93 none of it is easy.\xc2\xa0 But if we work together; if we summon what is best in us, with our feet planted firmly in today but our eyes cast towards tomorrow \xe2\x80\x93 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s within our reach.\xc2\xa0 Believe it. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.'
