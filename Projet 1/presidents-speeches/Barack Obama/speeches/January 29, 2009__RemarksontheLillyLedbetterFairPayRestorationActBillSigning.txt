b'It is fitting that with the very first bill I sign \xe2\x80\x93 the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act \xe2\x80\x93 we are upholding one of this nation\xe2\x80\x99s first principles: that we are all created equal and each deserve a chance to pursue our own version of happiness.\n\r\nIt is also fitting that we are joined today by the woman after whom this bill is named \xe2\x80\x93 someone Michelle and I have had the privilege of getting to know for ourselves. Lilly Ledbetter didn\xe2\x80\x99t set out to be a trailblazer or a household name. She was just a good hard worker who did her job \xe2\x80\x93 and did it well \xe2\x80\x93 for nearly two decades before discovering that for years, she was paid less than her male colleagues for the very same work. Over the course of her career, she lost more than $200,000 in salary, and even more in pension and Social Security benefits \xe2\x80\x93 losses she still feels today.\n\r\nNow, Lilly could have accepted her lot and moved on. She could have decided that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the hassle and harassment that would inevitably come with speaking up for what she deserved. But instead, she decided that there was a principle at stake, something worth fighting for. So she set out on a journey that would take more than ten years, take her all the way to the Supreme Court, and lead to this bill which will help others get the justice she was denied.\xc2\xa0\n\r\nBecause while this bill bears her name, Lilly knows this story isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about her. It\xe2\x80\x99s the story of women across this country still earning just 78 cents for every dollar men earn \xe2\x80\x93 women of color even less \xe2\x80\x93 which means that today, in the year 2009, countless women are still losing thousands of dollars in salary, income and retirement savings over the course of a lifetime.\xc2\xa0\n\r\nBut equal pay is by no means just a women\xe2\x80\x99s issue \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a family issue. It\xe2\x80\x99s about parents who find themselves with less money for tuition or child care; couples who wind up with less to retire on; households where, when one breadwinner is paid less than she deserves, that\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between affording the mortgage \xe2\x80\x93 or not; between keeping the heat on, or paying the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s bills \xe2\x80\x93 or not. And in this economy, when so many folks are already working harder for less and struggling to get by, the last thing they can afford is losing part of each month\xe2\x80\x99s paycheck to simple discrimination.\xc2\xa0\n\r\nSo in signing this bill today, I intend to send a clear message: That making our economy work means making sure it works for everyone. That there are no second class citizens in our workplaces, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just unfair and illegal \xe2\x80\x93 but bad for business \xe2\x80\x93 to pay someone less because of their gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion or disability. And that justice isn\xe2\x80\x99t about some abstract legal theory, or footnote in a casebook \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s about how our laws affect the daily realities of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives: their ability to make a living and care for their families and achieve their goals.\xc2\xa0\n\r\nUltimately, though, equal pay isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an economic issue for millions of Americans and their families, it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of who we are \xe2\x80\x93 and whether we\xe2\x80\x99re truly living up to our fundamental ideals. Whether we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our part, as generations before us, to ensure those words put to paper more than 200 years ago really mean something \xe2\x80\x93 to breathe new life into them with the more enlightened understandings of our time.\n\r\nThat is what Lilly Ledbetter challenged us to do. And today, I sign this bill not just in her honor, but in honor of those who came before her. Women like my grandmother who worked in a bank all her life, and even after she hit that glass ceiling, kept getting up and giving her best every day, without complaint, because she wanted something better for me and my sister.\n\r\nAnd I sign this bill for my daughters, and all those who will come after us, because I want them to grow up in a nation that values their contributions, where there are no limits to their dreams and they have opportunities their mothers and grandmothers never could have imagined.\n\r\nIn the end, that\xe2\x80\x99s why Lilly stayed the course. She knew it was too late for her \xe2\x80\x93 that this bill wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t undo the years of injustice she faced or restore the earnings she was denied. But this grandmother from Alabama kept on fighting, because she was thinking about the next generation. It\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done in America \xe2\x80\x93 set our sights high for ourselves, but even higher for our children and grandchildren.\n\r\nNow it\xe2\x80\x99s up to us to continue this work. This bill is an important step \xe2\x80\x93 a simple fix to ensure fundamental fairness to American workers \xe2\x80\x93 and I want to thank this remarkable and bi-partisan group of legislators who worked so hard to get it passed. And this is only the beginning. I know that if we stay focused, as Lilly did \xe2\x80\x93 and keep standing for what\xe2\x80\x99s right, as Lilly did \xe2\x80\x93 we will close that pay gap and ensure that our daughters have the same rights, the same chances, and the same freedom to pursue their dreams as our sons.\xc2\xa0\n\r\nThank you.'
