b"Good evening.\xc2\xa0 Nearly 10 years ago, America suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor.\xc2\xa0 This mass murder was planned by Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network in Afghanistan, and signaled a new threat to our security \xe2\x80\x93- one in which the targets were no longer soldiers on a battlefield, but innocent men, women and children going about their daily lives.\xc2\xa0 In the days that followed, our nation was united as we struck at al Qaeda and routed the Taliban in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Then, our focus shifted.\xc2\xa0 A second war was launched in Iraq, and we spent enormous blood and treasure to support a new government there.\xc2\xa0 By the time I took office, the war in Afghanistan had entered its seventh year.\xc2\xa0 But al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s leaders had escaped into Pakistan and were plotting new attacks, while the Taliban had regrouped and gone on the offensive.\xc2\xa0 Without a new strategy and decisive action, our military commanders warned that we could face a resurgent al Qaeda and a Taliban taking over large parts of Afghanistan. For this reason, in one of the most difficult decisions that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made as President, I ordered an additional 30,000 American troops into Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 When I announced this surge at West Point, we set clear objectives:\xc2\xa0 to refocus on al Qaeda, to reverse the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum, and train Afghan security forces to defend their own country.\xc2\xa0 I also made it clear that our commitment would not be open-ended, and that we would begin to draw down our forces this July. Tonight, I can tell you that we are fulfilling that commitment.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to our extraordinary men and women in uniform, our civilian personnel, and our many coalition partners, we are meeting our goals.\xc2\xa0 As a result, starting next month, we will be able to remove 10,000 of our troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year, and we will bring home a total of 33,000 troops by next summer, fully recovering the surge I announced at West Point.\xc2\xa0 After this initial reduction, our troops will continue coming home at a steady pace as Afghan security forces move into the lead.\xc2\xa0 Our mission will change from combat to support.\xc2\xa0 By 2014, this process of transition will be complete, and the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re starting this drawdown from a position of strength.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda is under more pressure than at any time since 9/11.\xc2\xa0 Together with the Pakistanis, we have taken out more than half of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0 And thanks to our intelligence professionals and Special Forces, we killed Osama bin Laden, the only leader that al Qaeda had ever known.\xc2\xa0 This was a victory for all who have served since 9/11.\xc2\xa0 One soldier summed it up well.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe message,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis we don\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\xc2\xa0 You will be held accountable, no matter how long it takes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The information that we recovered from bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound shows al Qaeda under enormous strain.\xc2\xa0 Bin Laden expressed concern that al Qaeda had been unable to effectively replace senior terrorists that had been killed, and that al Qaeda has failed in its effort to portray America as a nation at war with Islam -\xe2\x80\x93 thereby draining more widespread support.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda remains dangerous, and we must be vigilant against attacks.\xc2\xa0 But we have put al Qaeda on a path to defeat, and we will not relent until the job is done. In Afghanistan, we\xe2\x80\x99ve inflicted serious losses on the Taliban and taken a number of its strongholds.\xc2\xa0 Along with our surge, our allies also increased their commitments, which helped stabilize more of the country.\xc2\xa0 Afghan security forces have grown by over 100,000 troops, and in some provinces and municipalities we\xe2\x80\x99ve already begun to transition responsibility for security to the Afghan people.\xc2\xa0 In the face of violence and intimidation, Afghans are fighting and dying for their country, establishing local police forces, opening markets and schools, creating new opportunities for women and girls, and trying to turn the page on decades of war. Of course, huge challenges remain.\xc2\xa0 This is the beginning -- but not the end \xe2\x80\x93- of our effort to wind down this war.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do the hard work of keeping the gains that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, while we draw down our forces and transition responsibility for security to the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 And next May, in Chicago, we will host a summit with our NATO allies and partners to shape the next phase of this transition. We do know that peace cannot come to a land that has known so much war without a political settlement.\xc2\xa0 So as we strengthen the Afghan government and security forces, America will join initiatives that reconcile the Afghan people, including the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 Our position on these talks is clear:\xc2\xa0 They must be led by the Afghan government, and those who want to be a part of a peaceful Afghanistan must break from al Qaeda, abandon violence, and abide by the Afghan constitution.\xc2\xa0 But, in part because of our military effort, we have reason to believe that progress can be made. The goal that we seek is achievable, and can be expressed simply:\xc2\xa0 No safe haven from which al Qaeda or its affiliates can launch attacks against our homeland or our allies.\xc2\xa0 We won't try to make Afghanistan a perfect place.\xc2\xa0 We will not police its streets or patrol its mountains indefinitely.\xc2\xa0 That is the responsibility of the Afghan government, which must step up its ability to protect its people, and move from an economy shaped by war to one that can sustain a lasting peace.\xc2\xa0 What we can do, and will do, is build a partnership with the Afghan people that endures \xe2\x80\x93- one that ensures that we will be able to continue targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan government. Of course, our efforts must also address terrorist safe havens in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 No country is more endangered by the presence of violent extremists, which is why we will continue to press Pakistan to expand its participation in securing a more peaceful future for this war-torn region.\xc2\xa0 We'll work with the Pakistani government to root out the cancer of violent extremism, and we will insist that it keeps its commitments.\xc2\xa0 For there should be no doubt that so long as I am President, the United States will never tolerate a safe haven for those who aim to kill us.\xc2\xa0 They cannot elude us, nor escape the justice they deserve.\xc2\xa0 My fellow Americans, this has been a difficult decade for our country.\xc2\xa0 We've learned anew the profound cost of war -- a cost that's been paid by the nearly 4,500 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq, and the over 1,500 who have done so in Afghanistan -\xe2\x80\x93 men and women who will not live to enjoy the freedom that they defended.\xc2\xa0 Thousands more have been wounded. Some have lost limbs on the battlefield, and others still battle the demons that have followed them home. Yet tonight, we take comfort in knowing that the tide of war is receding.\xc2\xa0 Fewer of our sons and daughters are serving in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve ended our combat mission in Iraq, with 100,000 American troops already out of that country.\xc2\xa0 And even as there will be dark days ahead in Afghanistan, the light of a secure peace can be seen in the distance.\xc2\xa0 These long wars will come to a responsible end. As they do, we must learn their lessons.\xc2\xa0 Already this decade of war has caused many to question the nature of America\xe2\x80\x99s engagement around the world.\xc2\xa0 Some would have America retreat from our responsibility as an anchor of global security, and embrace an isolation that ignores the very real threats that we face.\xc2\xa0 Others would have America over-extended, confronting every evil that can be found abroad. We must chart a more centered course.\xc2\xa0 Like generations before, we must embrace America\xe2\x80\x99s singular role in the course of human events.\xc2\xa0 But we must be as pragmatic as we are passionate; as strategic as we are resolute.\xc2\xa0 When threatened, we must respond with force \xe2\x80\x93- but when that force can be targeted, we need not deploy large armies overseas.\xc2\xa0 When innocents are being slaughtered and global security endangered, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to choose between standing idly by or acting on our own.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we must rally international action, which we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Libya, where we do not have a single soldier on the ground, but are supporting allies in protecting the Libyan people and giving them the chance to determine their own destiny. In all that we do, we must remember that what sets America apart is not solely our power -\xe2\x80\x93 it is the principles upon which our union was founded.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a nation that brings our enemies to justice while adhering to the rule of law, and respecting the rights of all our citizens.\xc2\xa0 We protect our own freedom and prosperity by extending it to others.\xc2\xa0 We stand not for empire, but for self-determination.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have a stake in the democratic aspirations that are now washing across the Arab world.\xc2\xa0 We will support those revolutions with fidelity to our ideals, with the power of our example, and with an unwavering belief that all human beings deserve to live with freedom and dignity. Above all, we are a nation whose strength abroad has been anchored in opportunity for our citizens here at home.\xc2\xa0 Over the last decade, we have spent a trillion dollars on war, at a time of rising debt and hard economic times.\xc2\xa0 Now, we must invest in America\xe2\x80\x99s greatest resource \xe2\x80\x93- our people.\xc2\xa0 We must unleash innovation that creates new jobs and industries, while living within our means.\xc2\xa0 We must rebuild our infrastructure and find new and clean sources of energy.\xc2\xa0 And most of all, after a decade of passionate debate, we must recapture the common purpose that we shared at the beginning of this time of war.\xc2\xa0 For our nation draws strength from our differences, and when our union is strong no hill is too steep, no horizon is beyond our reach. America, it is time to focus on nation building here at home. In this effort, we draw inspiration from our fellow Americans who have sacrificed so much on our behalf.\xc2\xa0 To our troops, our veterans and their families, I speak for all Americans when I say that we will keep our sacred trust with you, and provide you with the care and benefits and opportunity that you deserve.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I met some of these patriotic Americans at Fort Campbell.\xc2\xa0 A while back, I spoke to the 101st Airborne that has fought to turn the tide in Afghanistan, and to the team that took out Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 Standing in front of a model of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s compound, the Navy SEAL who led that effort paid tribute to those who had been lost \xe2\x80\x93- brothers and sisters in arms whose names are now written on bases where our troops stand guard overseas, and on headstones in quiet corners of our country where their memory will never be forgotten.\xc2\xa0 This officer -- like so many others I\xe2\x80\x99ve met on bases, in Baghdad and Bagram, and at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital -\xe2\x80\x93 spoke with humility about how his unit worked together as one, depending on each other, and trusting one another, as a family might do in a time of peril.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson worth remembering -\xe2\x80\x93 that we are all a part of one American family.\xc2\xa0 Though we have known disagreement and division, we are bound together by the creed that is written into our founding documents, and a conviction that the United States of America is a country that can achieve whatever it sets out to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 Now, let us finish the work at hand.\xc2\xa0 Let us responsibly end these wars, and reclaim the American Dream that is at the center of our story.\xc2\xa0 With confidence in our cause, with faith in our fellow citizens, and with hope in our hearts, let us go about the work of extending the promise of America -\xe2\x80\x93 for this generation, and the next.\xc2\xa0 May God bless our troops.\xc2\xa0 And may God bless the United States of America."
