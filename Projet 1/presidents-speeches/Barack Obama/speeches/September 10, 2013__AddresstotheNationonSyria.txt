b"My fellow Americans, tonight I want to talk to you about Syria -- why it matters, and where we go from here. Over the past two years, what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad has turned into a brutal civil war.\xc2\xa0 Over 100,000 people have been killed.\xc2\xa0 Millions have fled the country.\xc2\xa0 In that time, America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support, to help the moderate opposition, and to shape a political settlement.\xc2\xa0 But I have resisted calls for military action, because we cannot resolve someone else\xe2\x80\x99s civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The situation profoundly changed, though, on August 21st, when Assad\xe2\x80\x99s government gassed to death over a thousand people, including hundreds of children.\xc2\xa0 The images from this massacre are sickening:\xc2\xa0 Men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas.\xc2\xa0 Others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath.\xc2\xa0 A father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.\xc2\xa0 On that terrible night, the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons, and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off-limits -- a crime against humanity, and a violation of the laws of war. This was not always the case.\xc2\xa0 In World War I, American GIs were among the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe.\xc2\xa0 In World War II, the Nazis used gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust.\xc2\xa0 Because these weapons can kill on a mass scale, with no distinction between soldier and infant, the civilized world has spent a century working to ban them.\xc2\xa0 And in 1997, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved an international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons, now joined by 189 governments that represent 98 percent of humanity. On August 21st, these basic rules were violated, along with our sense of common humanity.\xc2\xa0 No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The world saw thousands of videos, cell phone pictures, and social media accounts from the attack, and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas. Moreover, we know the Assad regime was responsible.\xc2\xa0 In the days leading up to August 21st, we know that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas.\xc2\xa0 They distributed gasmasks to their troops.\xc2\xa0 Then they fired rockets from a regime-controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces.\xc2\xa0 Shortly after those rockets landed, the gas spread, and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded.\xc2\xa0 We know senior figures in Assad\xe2\x80\x99s military machine reviewed the results of the attack, and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin. When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory.\xc2\xa0 But these things happened.\xc2\xa0 The facts cannot be denied. The question now is what the United States of America, and the international community, is prepared to do about it.\xc2\xa0 Because what happened to those people -- to those children -- is not only a violation of international law, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a danger to our security. Let me explain why.\xc2\xa0 If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 As the ban against these weapons erodes, other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas, and using them.\xc2\xa0 Over time, our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons, and to use them to attack civilians.\xc2\xa0 If fighting spills beyond Syria\xe2\x80\x99s borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.\xc2\xa0 And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction, and embolden Assad\xe2\x80\x99s ally, Iran -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path. This is not a world we should accept.\xc2\xa0 This is what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.\xc2\xa0 And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike.\xc2\xa0 The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regime\xe2\x80\x99s ability to use them, and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use.\xc2\xa0 That's my judgment as Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m also the President of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oldest constitutional democracy.\xc2\xa0 So even though I possess the authority to order military strikes, I believed it was right, in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security, to take this debate to Congress.\xc2\xa0 I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together.\xc2\xa0 This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war-making power in the hands of the President, and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops, while sidelining the people\xe2\x80\x99s representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force. Now, I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular.\xc2\xa0 After all, I've spent four and a half years working to end wars, not to start them.\xc2\xa0 Our troops are out of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And I know Americans want all of us in Washington -- especially me -- to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home:\xc2\xa0 putting people back to work, educating our kids, growing our middle class. It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder, then, that you're asking hard questions.\xc2\xa0 So let me answer some of the most important questions that I've heard from members of Congress, and that I've read in letters that you've sent to me. First, many of you have asked, won\xe2\x80\x99t this put us on a slippery slope to another war? \xc2\xa0One man wrote to me that we are \xe2\x80\x9cstill recovering from our involvement in Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 A veteran put it more bluntly:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThis nation is sick and tired of war.\xe2\x80\x9d My answer is simple:\xc2\xa0 I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.\xc2\xa0 This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective:\xc2\xa0 deterring the use of chemical weapons, and degrading Assad\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. Others have asked whether it's worth acting if we don\xe2\x80\x99t take out Assad.\xc2\xa0 As some members of Congress have said, there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in simply doing a \xe2\x80\x9cpinprick\xe2\x80\x9d strike in Syria. Let me make something clear:\xc2\xa0 The United States military doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do pinpricks.\xc2\xa0 Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.\xc2\xa0 I don't think we should remove another dictator with force -- we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next.\xc2\xa0 But a targeted strike can make Assad, or any other dictator, think twice before using chemical weapons. Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t dismiss any threats, but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military.\xc2\xa0 Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day.\xc2\xa0 Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise.\xc2\xa0 And our ally, Israel, can defend itself with overwhelming force, as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America. Many of you have asked a broader question:\xc2\xa0 Why should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated, and where\xc2\xa0 -- as one person wrote to me -- \xe2\x80\x9cthose who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights?\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s true that some of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s opponents are extremists.\xc2\xa0 But al Qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death.\xc2\xa0 The majority of the Syrian people -- and the Syrian opposition we work with -- just want to live in peace, with dignity and freedom.\xc2\xa0 And the day after any military action, we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism. Finally, many of you have asked:\xc2\xa0 Why not leave this to other countries, or seek solutions short of force?\xc2\xa0 As several people wrote to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWe should not be the world\xe2\x80\x99s policeman.\xe2\x80\x9d I agree, and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions.\xc2\xa0 Over the last two years, my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions, warning and negotiations -- but chemical weapons were still used by the Assad regime. However, over the last few days, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some encouraging signs.\xc2\xa0 In part because of the credible threat of U.S. military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin, the Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons, and even said they\xe2\x80\x99d join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.\xc2\xa0 But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s strongest allies. I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies, France and the United Kingdom, and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and to ultimately destroy them under international control.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21st.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas -- from Asia to the Middle East -- who agree on the need for action.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad, and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices. My fellow Americans, for nearly seven decades, the United States has been the anchor of global security.\xc2\xa0 This has meant doing more than forging international agreements -- it has meant enforcing them.\xc2\xa0 The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them.\xc2\xa0 And so, to my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile your commitment to America\xe2\x80\x99s military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just.\xc2\xa0 To my friends on the left, I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain, and going still on a cold hospital floor.\xc2\xa0 For sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough. Indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99d ask every member of Congress, and those of you watching at home tonight, to view those videos of the attack, and then ask:\xc2\xa0 What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas, and we choose to look the other way? Franklin Roosevelt once said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur national determination to keep free of foreign wars and foreign entanglements cannot prevent us from feeling deep concern when ideals and principles that we have cherished are challenged.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria, along with our leadership of a world where we seek to ensure that the worst weapons will never be used. America is not the world\xe2\x80\x99s policeman.\xc2\xa0 Terrible things happen across the globe, and it is beyond our means to right every wrong.\xc2\xa0 But when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes America different.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes us exceptional.\xc2\xa0 With humility, but with resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 God bless you.\xc2\xa0 And God bless the United States of America."
