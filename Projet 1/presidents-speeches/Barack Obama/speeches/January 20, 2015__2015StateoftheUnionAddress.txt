b"Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans:\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe are 15 years into this new century.\xc2\xa0 Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.\xc2\xa0 It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut tonight, we turn the page.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 More of our kids are graduating than ever before.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More of our people are insured than ever before.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in almost 30 years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.\xc2\xa0 And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We are humbled and grateful for your service.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAmerica, for all that we have endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:\xc2\xa0 The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAt this moment -- with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?\xc2\xa0 Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWill we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?\xc2\xa0 Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWill we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another?\xc2\xa0 Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.\xc2\xa0 And in the months ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.\xc2\xa0 So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt begins with our economy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 She waited tables.\xc2\xa0 He worked construction.\xc2\xa0 Their first child, Jack, was on the way.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They were young and in love in America.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much better than that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf only we had known,\xe2\x80\x9d Rebekah wrote to me last spring, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was about to happen to the housing and construction market.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAs the crisis worsened, Ben\xe2\x80\x99s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.\xc2\xa0 Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.\xc2\xa0 They sacrificed for each other.\xc2\xa0 And slowly, it paid off.\xc2\xa0 They bought their first home.\xc2\xa0 They had a second son, Henry.\xc2\xa0 Rebekah got a better job and then a raise.\xc2\xa0 Ben is back in construction -- and home for dinner every night.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is amazing,\xe2\x80\x9d Rebekah wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you can bounce back from when you have to\xe2\x80\xa6we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAmerica, Rebekah and Ben\xe2\x80\x99s story is our story.\xc2\xa0 They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped, and sacrificed and retooled.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You are the reason that I ran for this office.\xc2\xa0 You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.\xc2\xa0 And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores.\xc2\xa0 And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.\xc2\xa0 And today, America is number one in oil and gas.\xc2\xa0 America is number one in wind power.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And\xc2\xa0thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.\xc2\xa0 And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.\xc2\xa0 Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.\xc2\xa0 More Americans finish college than ever before.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.\xc2\xa0 Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAt every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade,\xc2\xa0our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is good news, people.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo the verdict is clear.\xc2\xa0 Middle-class economics works.\xc2\xa0 Expanding opportunity works.\xc2\xa0 And these policies will continue to work as long as politics don\xe2\x80\x99t get in the way.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to fix a broken system.\xc2\xa0 And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it.\xc2\xa0 It will have earned my veto.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nToday, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.\xc2\xa0 Wages are finally starting to rise again.\xc2\xa0 We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees\xe2\x80\x99 pay than at any time since 2007.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing:\xc2\xa0 Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t screw things up; that government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t halt the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making.\xc2\xa0 We need to do more than just do no harm.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, together, let\xe2\x80\x99s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBecause families like Rebekah\xe2\x80\x99s still need our help.\xc2\xa0 She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Friday night pizza, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big splurge.\xc2\xa0 Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.\xc2\xa0 Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn\xe2\x80\x99t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.\xc2\xa0 We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.\xc2\xa0 We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet -- tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what middle-class economics is -- the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t just want everyone to share in America\xe2\x80\x99s success, we want everyone to contribute to our success.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo what does middle-class economics require in our time?\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFirst, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.\xc2\xa0 That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s one example.\xc2\xa0 During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority -- so this country provided universal childcare.\xc2\xa0 In today\xe2\x80\x99s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a nice-to-have -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a must-have.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a women\xe2\x80\x99s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America -- by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s another example.\xc2\xa0 Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.\xc2\xa0 Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave -- 43 million.\xc2\xa0 Think about that.\xc2\xa0 And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.\xc2\xa0 And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let\xe2\x80\x99s put it to a vote right here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOf course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s 2015.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xc2\xa0 We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they\xe2\x80\x99ve earned.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:\xc2\xa0 If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, these ideas won\xe2\x80\x99t make everybody rich, won\xe2\x80\x99t relieve every hardship.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the job of government.\xc2\xa0 To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter\xe2\x80\x99s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company\xe2\x80\x99s long-term interest.\xc2\xa0 We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage -- these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do. Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world.\xc2\xa0 We were ahead of the curve.\xc2\xa0 But other countries caught on.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game.\xc2\xa0 We need to do more.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBy the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education -- two in three.\xc2\xa0 And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to them, and it\xe2\x80\x99s sure not smart for our future.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college -- to zero.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nKeep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college.\xc2\xa0 Some are young and starting out.\xc2\xa0 Some are older and looking for a better job.\xc2\xa0 Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.\xc2\xa0 Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt.\xc2\xa0 Understand, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to earn it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.\xc2\xa0 Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.\xc2\xa0 I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s stay ahead of the curve.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t derail anyone\xe2\x80\x99s dreams.\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThanks to Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s great work to update our job training system,\xc2\xa0we\xe2\x80\x99re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer moreeducational benefits and paid apprenticeships\xc2\xa0-- opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a higher education.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.\xc2\xa0 Already, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- (applause) -- thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:\xc2\xa0 If you want somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFinally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.\xc2\xa0 Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOur manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.\xc2\xa0 Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.\xc2\xa0 But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn\xe2\x80\x99t even exist 10 or 20 years ago -- jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0 But we do know we want them here in America.\xc2\xa0 We know that.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTwenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure -- modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTwenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.\xc2\xa0 Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.\xc2\xa0 But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world\xe2\x80\x99s fastest-growing region.\xc2\xa0 That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.\xc2\xa0 Why would we let that happen?\xc2\xa0 We should write those rules.\xc2\xa0 We should level the playing field.\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\xe2\x80\x99t just free, but are also fair.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLook, I\xe2\x80\x99m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven\xe2\x80\x99t always lived up to the hype, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But 95 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s customers live outside our borders.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t close ourselves off from those opportunities.\xc2\xa0 More than half of manufacturing executives have said they\xe2\x80\x99re actively looking to bring jobs back from China.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s give them one more reason to get it done.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTwenty-first century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development.\xc2\xa0 I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine -- one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes, and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.\xc2\xa0 We can do this.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI intend to protect a free and open Internet,\xc2\xa0extend its reach to every classroom, and every community -- (applause) -- and help folks build the fastest networks so that\xc2\xa0the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs -- converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Pushing out into the solar system not just to visit, but to stay.\xc2\xa0 Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a reenergized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.\xc2\xa0 And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.\xc2\xa0 So good luck, Captain.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Make sure to Instagram it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re proud of you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support in this chamber.\xc2\xa0 Members of both parties have told me so.\xc2\xa0 Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.\xc2\xa0 As Americans, we don\xe2\x80\x99t mind paying our fair share of taxes as long as everybody else does, too.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve riddled it with giveaways that the super-rich don\xe2\x80\x99t need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThis year, we have an opportunity to change that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest here in America.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and to make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And\xc2\xa0let\xe2\x80\x99s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.\xc2\xa0 We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We can achieve it together.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nHelping hardworking families make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.\xc2\xa0 Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 This is where America needs to go.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s where the American people want to go.\xc2\xa0 It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOf course, if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing this new century has taught us, it\xe2\x80\x99s that we cannot separate our work here at home from challenges beyond our shores.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nMy first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.\xc2\xa0 When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military -- then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what our enemies want us to do.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.\xc2\xa0 We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don\xe2\x80\x99t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now.\xc2\xa0 And around the globe, it is making a difference.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFirst, we stand united with people around the world who have been targeted by terrorists -- from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies.\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAt the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years.\xc2\xa0 Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we\xe2\x80\x99ve trained their security forces, who have now taken the lead, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve honored our troops\xe2\x80\x99 sacrifice by supporting that country\xe2\x80\x99s first democratic transition.\xc2\xa0 Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we\xe2\x80\x99re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn Iraq and Syria, American leadership -- including our military power -- is stopping ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s advance.\xc2\xa0 Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, this effort will take time.\xc2\xa0 It will require focus.\xc2\xa0 But we will succeed.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We need that authority.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSecond, we\xe2\x80\x99re demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re upholding the principle that bigger nations can\xe2\x80\x99t bully the small -- by opposing Russian aggression, and supporting Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLast year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with frontline states, Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s aggression it was suggested was a masterful display of strategy and strength.\xc2\xa0 That's what I heard from some folks.\xc2\xa0 Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated with its economy in tatters.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how America leads -- not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0 When what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work for 50 years, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to try something new.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 It removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 It stands up for democratic values, and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAs His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of \xe2\x80\x9csmall steps.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 And after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.\xc2\xa0 Welcome home, Alan.\xc2\xa0 We're glad you're here.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOur diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we\xe2\x80\x99ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.\xc2\xa0 Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies -- including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.\xc2\xa0There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails -- alienating America from its allies; making it harder to maintain sanctions; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.\xc2\xa0 And that's why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The American people expect us only to go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThird, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.\xc2\xa0 No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So we're making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd tonight,\xc2\xa0I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children\xe2\x80\x99s information.\xc2\xa0 That should be a bipartisan effort.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t act, we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.\xc2\xa0 If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses, our health care workers are rolling back Ebola -- saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.\xc2\xa0 But the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules -- in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.\xc2\xa0 And\xc2\xa0no challenge -- no challenge -- poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\n2014 was the planet\xe2\x80\x99s warmest year on record.\xc2\xa0 Now, one year doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a trend, but this does:\xc2\xa0 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they\xe2\x80\x99re not scientists; that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough information to act.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a scientist, either.\xc2\xa0 But you know what, I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and at NOAA, and at our major universities.\xc2\xa0 And the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t act forcefully, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.\xc2\xa0 We should act like it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why, over the past six years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy to the way we use it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why\xc2\xa0I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.\xc2\xa0 I am determined to make sure that American leadership drives international action.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn Beijing, we made a historic announcement:\xc2\xa0 The United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 And China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.\xc2\xa0 And because the world\xe2\x80\x99s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that this year the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s one last pillar of our leadership, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the example of our values.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAs Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we\xe2\x80\x99re threatened, which is why I have prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\xc2\xa0 We do these things not only because they are the right thing to do, but because ultimately they will make us safer.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAs Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice.\xc2\xa0 So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been President, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half.\xc2\xa0 Now it is time to finish the job.\xc2\xa0 And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.\xc2\xa0 It is not who we are.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to close Gitmo.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.\xc2\xa0 So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not.\xc2\xa0 As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.\xc2\xa0 And next month, we\xe2\x80\x99ll issue a report on how we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLooking to the future instead of the past.\xc2\xa0 Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.\xc2\xa0 Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.\xc2\xa0 Leading -- always -- with the example of our values.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes us exceptional.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what keeps us strong.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards -- our own.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nYou know, just\xc2\xa0over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a liberal America or a conservative America; a black America or a white America -- but a United States of America.\xc2\xa0 I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home -- a state of small towns, rich farmland,\xc2\xa0one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOver the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn\xe2\x80\x99t delivered on this vision.\xc2\xa0 How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s held up as proof not just of my own flaws -- of which there are many -- but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, na\xc3\xafve, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI know how tempting such cynicism may be.\xc2\xa0 But I still think the cynics are wrong.\xc2\xa0 I still believe that we are one people.\xc2\xa0 I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California, and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, New London.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown, in Boston, in West Texas, and West Virginia.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in 10 Americans call home.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who every day live the idea that we are our brother\xe2\x80\x99s keeper and our sister\xe2\x80\x99s keeper.\xc2\xa0 And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America\xe2\x80\x99s hopes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve served in Congress with many of you.\xc2\xa0 I know many of you well.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.\xc2\xa0 And many of you have told me that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you signed up for -- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nImagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.\xc2\xa0 Imagine if we did something different.\xc2\xa0 Understand, a better politics isn\xe2\x80\x99t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.\xc2\xa0 A better politics is one where we appeal to each other\xe2\x80\x99s basic decency instead of our basest fears.\xc2\xa0 A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues and values, and principles and facts, rather than \xe2\x80\x9cgotcha\xe2\x80\x9d moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people\xe2\x80\x99s daily lives.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nA politics -- a better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIf we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have arguments, let\xe2\x80\x99s have arguments, but let\xe2\x80\x99s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.\xc2\xa0 We still may not agree on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose, but surely we can agree it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nYes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to Republicans and Democrats about that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we can share.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it\xe2\x80\x99s being denied to too many\xc2\xa0-- (applause) -- and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.\xc2\xa0 But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can\xe2\x80\x99t walk home without being harassed.\xc2\xa0 And surely we can understand the wife who won\xe2\x80\x99t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Andsurely we can agree that it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America\xe2\x80\x99s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a better politics.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we start rebuilding trust.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we move this country forward.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people want.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they deserve.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI have no more campaigns to run.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 My only agenda -- (laughter) --\xc2\xa0I know because I won both of them.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I\xe2\x80\x99ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol -- to do what I believe is best for America.\xc2\xa0 If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand.\xc2\xa0 If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll at least work with me where you do agree.\xc2\xa0 And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBecause I want this chamber, I want this city to reflect the truth -- that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI want our actions to tell every child in every neighborhood, your life matters, and we are committed to improving your life chances as committed as we are to working on behalf of our own kids.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we\xe2\x80\x99re a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen -- man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino, Asian, immigrant, Native American, gay, straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.\xc2\xa0 Everybody matters.\xc2\xa0 I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:\xc2\xa0 that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story that sums up these past six years:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to\xe2\x80\xa6we are a strong, tight-knit family who\xe2\x80\x99s made it through some very, very hard times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nMy fellow Americans, we, too, are a strong, tight-knit family.\xc2\xa0 We, too, have made it through some hard times.\xc2\xa0 Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.\xc2\xa0 We have laid a new foundation.\xc2\xa0 A brighter future is ours to write.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin this new chapter together -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s start the work right now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThank you.\xc2\xa0 God bless you.\xc2\xa0 God bless this country we love.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0"
