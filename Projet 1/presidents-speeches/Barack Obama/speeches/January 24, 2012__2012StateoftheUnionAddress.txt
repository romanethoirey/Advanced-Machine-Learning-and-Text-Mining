b'\xc2\xa0Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans: Last month, I went to Andrews Air Force Base and welcomed home some of our last troops to serve in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Together, we offered a final, proud salute to the colors under which more than a million of our fellow citizens fought -- and several thousand gave their lives. We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Most of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s top lieutenants have been defeated.\xc2\xa0 The Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. These achievements are a testament to the courage, selflessness and teamwork of America\xe2\x80\x99s Armed Forces.\xc2\xa0 At a time when too many of our institutions have let us down, they exceed all expectations.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not consumed with personal ambition.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t obsess over their differences.\xc2\xa0 They focus on the mission at hand.\xc2\xa0 They work together.\xc2\xa0 Imagine what we could accomplish if we followed their example.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Think about the America within our reach:\xc2\xa0 A country that leads the world in educating its people.\xc2\xa0 An America that attracts a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and high-paying jobs.\xc2\xa0 A\xc2\xa0future where we\xe2\x80\x99re in control of our own energy, and our security and prosperity aren\xe2\x80\x99t so tied to unstable parts of the world.\xc2\xa0 An economy built to last, where hard work pays off, and responsibility is rewarded. We can do this.\xc2\xa0 I know we can, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before.\xc2\xa0 At the end of World War II, when another generation of heroes returned home from combat, they built the strongest economy and middle class the world has ever known.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 My grandfather, a veteran of Patton\xe2\x80\x99s Army, got the chance to go to college on the GI Bill.\xc2\xa0 My grandmother, who worked on a bomber assembly line, was part of a workforce that turned out the best products on Earth.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThe two of them shared the optimism of a nation that had triumphed over a depression and fascism.\xc2\xa0 They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share -- the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.\xc2\xa0 The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive.\xc2\xa0 No challenge is more urgent.\xc2\xa0 No debate is more important.\xc2\xa0 We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s at stake aren\xe2\x80\x99t Democratic values or Republican values, but American values.\xc2\xa0 And we have to reclaim them. Let\xe2\x80\x99s remember how we got here.\xc2\xa0 Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores.\xc2\xa0 Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete.\xc2\xa0 Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that weren\xe2\x80\x99t, and personal debt that kept piling up. In 2008, the house of cards collapsed.\xc2\xa0 We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford or understand them.\xc2\xa0 Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other people\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xc2\xa0 Regulators had looked the other way, or didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the authority to stop the bad behavior. It was wrong.\xc2\xa0 It was irresponsible.\xc2\xa0 And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag.\xc2\xa0 In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect. Those are the facts.\xc2\xa0 But so are these:\xc2\xa0 In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005.\xc2\xa0 American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Together, we\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) The state of our Union is getting stronger.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve come too far to turn back now.\xc2\xa0 As long as I\xe2\x80\x99m President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum.\xc2\xa0 But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy that\xe2\x80\x99s built to last -\xe2\x80\x93 an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values. Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing. On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse.\xc2\xa0 Some even said we should let it die.\xc2\xa0 With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen.\xc2\xa0 In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility.\xc2\xa0 We got workers and automakers to settle their differences.\xc2\xa0 We got the industry to retool and restructure.\xc2\xa0 Today, General Motors is back on top as the world\xe2\x80\x99s number-one automaker.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company.\xc2\xa0 Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories.\xc2\xa0 And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We bet on American workers.\xc2\xa0 We bet on American ingenuity.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, the American auto industry is back.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Detroit can happen in other industries.\xc2\xa0 It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t bring every job back that\xe2\x80\x99s left our shore.\xc2\xa0 But right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting more expensive to do business in places like China.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, America is more productive.\xc2\xa0 A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Lock\xe2\x80\x99s unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back.\xc2\xa0 But we have to seize it.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple:\xc2\xa0 Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We should start with our tax code.\xc2\xa0 Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world.\xc2\xa0 It makes no sense, and everyone knows it.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s change it.\xc2\xa0 First, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a tax deduction for doing it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax.\xc2\xa0 And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Third, if you\xe2\x80\x99re an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here.\xc2\xa0 And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my message is simple.\xc2\xa0 It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.\xc2\xa0 Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years.\xc2\xa0 With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule.\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea.\xc2\xa0 Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products.\xc2\xa0 And I will not stand by when our competitors don\xe2\x80\x99t play by the rules.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last administration \xe2\x80\x93- and it\xe2\x80\x99s made a difference.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires.\xc2\xa0 But we need to do more.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because they\xe2\x80\x99re heavily subsidized. Tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders.\xc2\xa0 And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia.\xc2\xa0 Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -\xe2\x80\x93 America will always win.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but can\xe2\x80\x99t find workers with the right skills.\xc2\xa0 Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job.\xc2\xa0 Think about that \xe2\x80\x93- openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s inexcusable.\xc2\xa0 And we know how to fix it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic.\xc2\xa0 Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College.\xc2\xa0 The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training.\xc2\xa0 It paid Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant. I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 My administration has already lined up more companies that want to help.\xc2\xa0 Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running.\xc2\xa0 Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers -\xe2\x80\x93 places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need.\xc2\xa0 It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nThese reforms will help people get jobs that are open today.\xc2\xa0 But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier. For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in a generation. But challenges remain.\xc2\xa0 And we know how to solve them. At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers.\xc2\xa0 We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000.\xc2\xa0 A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance.\xc2\xa0 Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives.\xc2\xa0 Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference. Teachers matter.\xc2\xa0 So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, let\xe2\x80\x99s offer schools a deal.\xc2\xa0 Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And in return, grant schools flexibility:\xc2\xa0 to teach with creativity and passion; to\xc2\xa0stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just aren\xe2\x80\x99t helping kids learn.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a bargain worth making.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We also know that when students don\xe2\x80\x99t walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma.\xc2\xa0 When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18.\xc2\xa0(Applause.) When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for us to increase student aid.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; we\xe2\x80\x99ll run out of money.\xc2\xa0 States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets.\xc2\xa0 And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents who\xe2\x80\x99ve done just that.\xc2\xa0 Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly.\xc2\xa0 Some use better technology.\xc2\xa0 The point is, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 So let me put colleges and universities on notice:\xc2\xa0 If you can\xe2\x80\x99t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Higher education can\xe2\x80\x99t be a luxury\xc2\xa0-\xe2\x80\x93 it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. Let\xe2\x80\x99s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge:\xc2\xa0 the fact that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet American citizens.\xc2\xa0 Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.\xc2\xa0 Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why my administration has put more boots on the border than ever before.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office.\xc2\xa0 The opponents of action are out of excuses.\xc2\xa0 We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, let\xe2\x80\x99s at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country.\xc2\xa0 Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship.\xc2\xa0 I will sign it right away.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country.\xc2\xa0 That means women should earn equal pay for equal work.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It means we should support everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After all,\xc2\xa0innovation is what America has always been about.\xc2\xa0 Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s pass an agenda that helps them succeed.\xc2\xa0 Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs.\xc2\xa0 Both parties agree on these ideas.\xc2\xa0 So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Innovation also demands basic research.\xc2\xa0 Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.\xc2\xa0 New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t gut these investments in our budget.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t let other countries win the race for the future.\xc2\xa0 Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries. And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.\xc2\xa0 Over the last three years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and\xc2\xa0tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that it\xe2\x80\x99s been in eight years.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right -- eight years.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) But with only 2 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil reserves, oil isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough.\xc2\xa0 This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 A strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And my administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.\xc2\xa0 Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk. The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to choose between our environment and our economy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock \xe2\x80\x93- reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, what\xe2\x80\x99s true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy.\xc2\xa0 In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.\xc2\xa0 Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.\xc2\xa0 When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance.\xc2\xa0 But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.\xc2\xa0 Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.\xc2\xa0 Today, it\xe2\x80\x99s hiring workers like Bryan, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m proud to be working in the industry of the future.\xe2\x80\x9d Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments don\xe2\x80\x99t always come right away.\xc2\xa0 Some technologies don\xe2\x80\x99t pan out; some companies fail.\xc2\xa0 But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.\xc2\xa0 I will not walk away from workers like Bryan.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve subsidized oil companies for a century.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s long enough.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.\xc2\xa0 Pass clean energy tax credits.\xc2\xa0 Create these jobs.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why Congress shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.\xc2\xa0 So far, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t acted.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Well, tonight, I will.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m directing my administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history -\xe2\x80\x93 with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy.\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal:\xc2\xa0 Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.\xc2\xa0 Their energy bills will be $100 billion lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them.\xc2\xa0 Send me a bill that creates these jobs.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair America\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 So much of America needs to be rebuilt.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got crumbling roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.\xc2\xa0 During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.\xc2\xa0 After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways.\xc2\xa0 Democratic and Republican administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today. In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects.\xc2\xa0 But you need to fund these projects.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Take the money we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) There\xe2\x80\x99s never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst.\xc2\xa0 Of course, construction workers weren\xe2\x80\x99t the only ones who were hurt.\xc2\xa0 So were millions of innocent Americans who\xe2\x80\x99ve seen their home values decline.\xc2\xa0 And while government can\xe2\x80\x99t fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 No more red tape.\xc2\xa0 No more runaround from the banks.\xc2\xa0 A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won\xe2\x80\x99t add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Let\xe2\x80\x99s never forget:\xc2\xa0 Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to apply the same rules from top to bottom.\xc2\xa0 No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts.\xc2\xa0 An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford them, and buyers who knew they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these don\xe2\x80\x99t destroy the free market.\xc2\xa0 They make the free market work better. There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than $10 billion over the next five years.\xc2\xa0We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend $10,000 a year proving that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.\xc2\xa0 With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over\xc2\xa0spilled milk.\xc2\xa0(Laughter and applause.) Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean.\xc2\xa0 I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules.\xc2\xa0 The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial system\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose:\xc2\xa0 Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to college. So if you are a big bank or financial institution, you\xe2\x80\x99re no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers\xe2\x80\x99 deposits.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re required to write out a \xe2\x80\x9cliving will\xe2\x80\x9d that details exactly how you\xe2\x80\x99ll pay the bills if you fail \xe2\x80\x93- because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job:\xc2\xa0 To look out for them.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect people\xe2\x80\x99s investments.\xc2\xa0 Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because there\xe2\x80\x99s no real penalty for being a repeat offender.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s bad for consumers, and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.\xc2\xa0 Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy.\xc2\xa0 But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future. Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0People cannot afford losing $40 out of each paycheck this year.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are plenty of ways to get this done.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s agree right here, right now:\xc2\xa0 No side issues.\xc2\xa0 No drama.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.) When it comes to the deficit, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings.\xc2\xa0 But we need to do more, and that means making choices.\xc2\xa0 Right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.\xc2\xa0 Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households.\xc2\xa0 Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?\xc2\xa0 Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else \xe2\x80\x93- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans?\xc2\xa0 Because if we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about paying down our debt, we can\xe2\x80\x99t do both.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The American people know what the right choice is.\xc2\xa0 So do I.\xc2\xa0 As I told the Speaker this summer, I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.\xc2\xa0 But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule.\xc2\xa0 If you make more than $1 million a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes.\xc2\xa0 And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right:\xc2\xa0 Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires.\xc2\xa0 In fact, if you\xe2\x80\x99re earning a million dollars a year, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get special tax subsidies or deductions.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go up.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who need relief.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you can call this class warfare all you want.\xc2\xa0 But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes?\xc2\xa0 Most Americans would call that common sense.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t begrudge financial success in this country.\xc2\xa0 We admire it.\xc2\xa0 When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it\xe2\x80\x99s not because they envy the rich.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because they understand that when I get a tax break I don\xe2\x80\x99t need and the country can\xe2\x80\x99t afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not right.\xc2\xa0 Americans know that\xe2\x80\x99s not right.\xc2\xa0 They know that this generation\xe2\x80\x99s success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99ll reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an America built to last.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care.\xc2\xa0 But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now:\xc2\xa0 Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken. Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?\xc2\xa0 The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didn\xe2\x80\x99t come from events beyond our control.\xc2\xa0 It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not.\xc2\xa0 Who benefited from that fiasco? I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked tonight about the deficit of trust between Main Street and Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 But the divide between this city and the rest of the country is at least as bad -- and it seems to get worse every year. Some of this has to do with the corrosive influence of money in politics.\xc2\xa0 So together, let\xe2\x80\x99s take some steps to fix that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress; I will sign it tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure people who bundle campaign contributions for Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t lobby Congress, and vice versa -- an idea that has bipartisan support, at least outside of Washington.\xc2\xa0 Some of what\xe2\x80\x99s broken has to do with the way Congress does its business these days.\xc2\xa0 A simple majority is no longer enough to get anything -\xe2\x80\x93 even routine business \xe2\x80\x93- passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Neither party has been blameless in these tactics.\xc2\xa0 Now both parties should put an end to it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For starters, I ask the Senate to pass a simple rule that all judicial and public service nominations receive a simple up or down vote within 90 days.\xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The executive branch also needs to change.\xc2\xa0 Too often, it\xe2\x80\x99s inefficient, outdated and remote.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked this Congress to grant me the authority to consolidate the federal bureaucracy, so that our government is leaner, quicker, and more responsive to the needs of the American people.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, none of this can happen unless we also lower the temperature in this town.\xc2\xa0 We need to end the notion that the two parties must be locked in a perpetual campaign of mutual destruction; that politics is about clinging to rigid ideologies instead of building consensus around common-sense ideas.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m a Democrat.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I believe what Republican Abraham Lincoln believed:\xc2\xa0 That government should do for people only what they cannot do better by themselves, and no more.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why my education reform offers more competition, and more control for schools and states.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re getting rid of regulations that don\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why our health care law relies on a reformed private market, not a government program.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, even my Republican friends who complain the most about government spending have supported federally financed roads, and clean energy projects, and federal offices for the folks back home.\xc2\xa0 The point is, we should all want a smarter, more effective government.\xc2\xa0 And while we may not be able to bridge our biggest philosophical differences this year, we can make real progress.\xc2\xa0 With or without this Congress, I will keep taking actions that help the economy grow.\xc2\xa0 But I can do a whole lot more with your help.\xc2\xa0 Because when we act together, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the United States of America can\xe2\x80\x99t achieve.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the lesson we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from our actions abroad over the last few years. Ending the Iraq war has allowed us to strike decisive blows against our enemies.\xc2\xa0 From Pakistan to Yemen, the al Qaeda operatives who remain are scrambling, knowing that they can\xe2\x80\x99t escape the reach of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) From this position of strength, we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to wind down the war in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Ten thousand of our troops have come home.\xc2\xa0 Twenty-three thousand more will leave by the end of this summer.\xc2\xa0 This transition to Afghan lead will continue, and we will build an enduring partnership with Afghanistan, so that it is never again a source of attacks against America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) As the tide of war recedes, a wave of change has washed across the Middle East and North Africa, from Tunis to Cairo; from Sana\xe2\x80\x99a to Tripoli.\xc2\xa0 A year ago, Qaddafi was one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s longest-serving dictators -\xe2\x80\x93 a murderer with American blood on his hands.\xc2\xa0 Today, he is gone.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in Syria, I have no doubt that the Assad regime will soon discover that the forces of change cannot be reversed, and that human dignity cannot be denied.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(Applause.) How this incredible transformation will end remains uncertain.\xc2\xa0 But we have a huge stake in the outcome.\xc2\xa0 And while it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately up to the people of the region to decide their fate, we will advocate for those values that have served our own country so well.\xc2\xa0 We will stand against violence and intimidation.\xc2\xa0 We will stand for the rights and dignity of all human beings \xe2\x80\x93- men and women; Christians, Muslims and Jews.\xc2\xa0 We will support policies that lead to strong and stable democracies and open markets, because tyranny is no match for liberty. And we will safeguard America\xe2\x80\x99s own security against those who threaten our citizens, our friends, and our interests.\xc2\xa0 Look at Iran.\xc2\xa0 Through the power of our diplomacy, a world that was once divided about how to deal with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program now stands as one.\xc2\xa0 The regime is more isolated than ever before; its leaders are faced with crippling sanctions, and as long as they shirk their responsibilities, this pressure will not relent. Let there be no doubt:\xc2\xa0 America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations. The renewal of American leadership can be felt across the globe.\xc2\xa0 Our oldest alliances in Europe and Asia are stronger than ever.\xc2\xa0 Our ties to the Americas are deeper.\xc2\xa0 Our ironclad commitment -- and I mean ironclad -- to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear that America is a Pacific power, and a new beginning in Burma has lit a new hope.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the coalitions we\xe2\x80\x99ve built to secure nuclear materials, to the missions we\xe2\x80\x99ve led against hunger and disease; from the blows we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt to our enemies, to the enduring power of our moral example, America is back.\xc2\xa0 Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that America is in decline or that our influence has waned, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) That\xe2\x80\x99s not the message we get from leaders around the world who are eager to work with us.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how people feel from Tokyo to Berlin, from Cape Town to Rio, where opinions of America are higher than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in years.\xc2\xa0 Yes, the world is changing.\xc2\xa0 No, we can\xe2\x80\x99t control every event.\xc2\xa0 But America remains the one indispensable nation in world affairs \xe2\x80\x93- and as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m President, I intend to keep it that way.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why, working with our military leaders, I\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed a new defense strategy that ensures we maintain the finest military in the world, while saving nearly half a trillion dollars in our budget.\xc2\xa0 To stay one step ahead of our adversaries, I\xe2\x80\x99ve already sent this Congress legislation that will secure our country from the growing dangers of cyber-threats.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Above all, our freedom endures because of the men and women in uniform who defend it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 As they come home, we must serve them as well as they\xe2\x80\x99ve served us.\xc2\xa0 That includes giving them the care and the benefits they have earned \xe2\x80\x93- which is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve increased annual VA spending every year I\xe2\x80\x99ve been President.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And it means enlisting our veterans in the work of rebuilding our nation. With the bipartisan support of this Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99re providing new tax credits to companies that hire vets.\xc2\xa0 Michelle and Jill Biden have worked with American businesses to secure a pledge of\xc2\xa0135,000 jobs for veterans and their families.\xc2\xa0 And tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m proposing a Veterans Jobs Corps that will help our communities hire veterans as cops and firefighters, so that America is as strong as those who defend her.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Which brings me back to where I began.\xc2\xa0 Those of us who\xe2\x80\x99ve been sent here to serve can learn a thing or two from the service of our troops.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When you put on that uniform, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re black or white; Asian, Latino, Native American; conservative, liberal; rich, poor; gay, straight.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When you\xe2\x80\x99re marching into battle, you look out for the person next to you, or the mission fails.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re in the thick of the fight, you rise or fall as one unit, serving one nation, leaving no one behind. One of my proudest possessions is the flag that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 On it are each of their names.\xc2\xa0 Some may be Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Some may be Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xc2\xa0 Just like it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that day in the Situation Room, when I sat next to Bob Gates -- a man who was George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s defense secretary -- and Hillary Clinton -- a woman who ran against me for president.\xc2\xa0 All that mattered that day was the mission.\xc2\xa0 No one thought about politics.\xc2\xa0 No one thought about themselves.\xc2\xa0 One of the young men involved in the raid later told me that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve credit for the mission.\xc2\xa0 It only succeeded, he said, because every single member of that unit did their job -- the pilot who landed the helicopter that spun out of control; the translator who kept others from entering the compound; the troops who separated the women and children from the fight; the SEALs who charged up the stairs.\xc2\xa0 More than that, the mission only succeeded because every member of that unit trusted each other -- because you can\xe2\x80\x99t charge up those stairs, into darkness and danger, unless you know that there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody behind you, watching your back. So it is with America.\xc2\xa0 Each time I look at that flag, I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded that our destiny is stitched together like those 50 stars and those 13 stripes.\xc2\xa0 No one built this country on their own.\xc2\xa0 This nation is great because we built it together.\xc2\xa0 This nation is great because we worked as a team.\xc2\xa0 This nation is great because we get each other\xe2\x80\x99s backs.\xc2\xa0 And if we hold fast to that truth, in this moment of trial, there is no challenge too great; no mission too hard.\xc2\xa0 As long as we are joined in common purpose, as long as we maintain our common resolve, our journey moves forward, and our future is hopeful, and the state of our Union will always be strong. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
