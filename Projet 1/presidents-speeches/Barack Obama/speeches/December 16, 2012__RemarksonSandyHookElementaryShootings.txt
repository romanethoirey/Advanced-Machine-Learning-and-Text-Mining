b'Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0Thank you, Governor.\xc2\xa0 To all the families, first responders, to the community of Newtown, clergy, guests -- Scripture tells us: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6do not lose heart. \xc2\xa0Though outwardly we are wasting away\xe2\x80\xa6inwardly we are being renewed day by day.\xc2\xa0 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all. \xc2\xa0So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal. \xc2\xa0For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.\xe2\x80\x9d We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults.\xc2\xa0 They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school; in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America. Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation.\xc2\xa0 I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts.\xc2\xa0 I can only hope it helps for you to know that you\xe2\x80\x99re not alone in your grief; that our world too has been torn apart; that all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, we\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled our children tight.\xc2\xa0 And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide; whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it.\xc2\xa0 Newtown -- you are not alone. As these difficult days have unfolded, you\xe2\x80\x99ve also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary, the school\xe2\x80\x99s staff did not flinch, they did not hesitate.\xc2\xa0 Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy -- they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances -- with courage and with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care. We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms, and kept steady through it all, and reassured their students by saying \xe2\x80\x9cwait for the good guys, they\xe2\x80\x99re coming\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cshow me your smile.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And we know that good guys came.\xc2\xa0 The first responders who raced to the scene, helping to guide those in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way to safety, and comfort those in need, holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do, and others needed them more. And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren, helping one another, holding each other, dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do; one child even trying to encourage a grown-up by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI know karate.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll lead the way out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) As a community, you\xe2\x80\x99ve inspired us, Newtown.\xc2\xa0 In the face of indescribable violence, in the face of unconscionable evil, you\xe2\x80\x99ve looked out for each other, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve cared for one another, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve loved one another.\xc2\xa0 This is how Newtown will be remembered.\xc2\xa0 And with time, and God\xe2\x80\x99s grace, that love will see you through. But we, as a nation, we are left with some hard questions.\xc2\xa0 Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time, walking around.\xc2\xa0 With their very first cry, this most precious, vital part of ourselves -- our child -- is suddenly exposed to the world, to possible mishap or malice.\xc2\xa0 And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm.\xc2\xa0 And yet, we also know that with that child\xe2\x80\x99s very first step, and each step after that, they are separating from us; that we won\xe2\x80\x99t -- that we can\xe2\x80\x99t always be there for them.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments.\xc2\xa0 And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self-reliant and capable and resilient, ready to face the world without fear.\xc2\xa0 And we know we can\xe2\x80\x99t do this by ourselves.\xc2\xa0 It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize, no matter how much you love these kids, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it by yourself.\xc2\xa0 That this job of keeping our children safe, and teaching them well, is something we can only do together, with the help of friends and neighbors, the help of a community, and the help of a nation.\xc2\xa0 And in that way, we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because we\xe2\x80\x99re counting on everybody else to help look after ours; that we\xe2\x80\x99re all parents; that they\xe2\x80\x99re all our children.\xc2\xa0 This is our first task -- caring for our children.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our first job.\xc2\xa0 If we don\xe2\x80\x99t get that right, we don\xe2\x80\x99t get anything right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how, as a society, we will be judged. And by that measure, can we truly say, as a nation, that we are meeting our obligations?\xc2\xa0 Can we honestly say that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm?\xc2\xa0 Can we claim, as a nation, that we\xe2\x80\x99re all together there, letting them know that they are loved, and teaching them to love in return?\xc2\xa0 Can we say that we\xe2\x80\x99re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose? I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reflecting on this the last few days, and if we\xe2\x80\x99re honest with ourselves, the answer is no.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not doing enough.\xc2\xa0 And we will have to change. Since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been President, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting.\xc2\xa0 The fourth time we\xe2\x80\x99ve hugged survivors.\xc2\xa0 The fourth time we\xe2\x80\x99ve consoled the families of victims.\xc2\xa0 And in between, there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them children, in small towns and big cities all across America -- victims whose -- much of the time, their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. We can\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate this anymore.\xc2\xa0 These tragedies must end.\xc2\xa0 And to end them, we must change.\xc2\xa0 We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true.\xc2\xa0 No single law -- no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. But that can\xe2\x80\x99t be an excuse for inaction.\xc2\xa0 Surely, we can do better than this.\xc2\xa0 If there is even one step we can take to save another child, or another parent, or another town, from the grief that has visited Tucson, and Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that -- then surely we have an obligation to try.\xc2\xa0 In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.\xc2\xa0 Because what choice do we have?\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t accept events like this as routine.\xc2\xa0 Are we really prepared to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard? \xc2\xa0Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom? All the world\xe2\x80\x99s religions -- so many of them represented here today -- start with a simple question:\xc2\xa0 Why are we here?\xc2\xa0 What gives our life meaning? \xc2\xa0What gives our acts purpose?\xc2\xa0 We know our time on this Earth is fleeting.\xc2\xa0 We know that we will each have our share of pleasure and pain; that even after we chase after some earthly goal, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s wealth or power or fame, or just simple comfort, we will, in some fashion, fall short of what we had hoped.\xc2\xa0 We know that no matter how good our intentions, we will all stumble sometimes, in some way. \xc2\xa0We will make mistakes, we will experience hardships.\xc2\xa0 And even when we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do the right thing, we know that much of our time will be spent groping through the darkness, so often unable to discern God\xe2\x80\x99s heavenly plans.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s only one thing we can be sure of, and that is the love that we have -- for our children, for our families, for each other.\xc2\xa0 The warmth of a small child\xe2\x80\x99s embrace -- that is true.\xc2\xa0 The memories we have of them, the joy that they bring, the wonder we see through their eyes, that fierce and boundless love we feel for them, a love that takes us out of ourselves, and binds us to something larger -- we know that\xe2\x80\x99s what matters.\xc2\xa0 We know we\xe2\x80\x99re always doing right when we\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of them, when we\xe2\x80\x99re teaching them well, when we\xe2\x80\x99re showing acts of kindness.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t go wrong when we do that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we can be sure of.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you, the people of Newtown, have reminded us.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how you\xe2\x80\x99ve inspired us.\xc2\xa0 You remind us what matters.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what should drive us forward in everything we do, for as long as God sees fit to keep us on this Earth. \xe2\x80\x9cLet the little children come to me,\xe2\x80\x9d Jesus said, \xe2\x80\x9cand do not hinder them -- for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.\xe2\x80\x9d Charlotte.\xc2\xa0 Daniel.\xc2\xa0 Olivia.\xc2\xa0 Josephine. \xc2\xa0Ana.\xc2\xa0 Dylan.\xc2\xa0 Madeleine.\xc2\xa0 Catherine.\xc2\xa0 Chase.\xc2\xa0 Jesse.\xc2\xa0 James.\xc2\xa0 Grace.\xc2\xa0 Emilie.\xc2\xa0 Jack.\xc2\xa0 Noah.\xc2\xa0 Caroline.\xc2\xa0 Jessica.\xc2\xa0 Benjamin.\xc2\xa0 Avielle.\xc2\xa0 Allison.\xc2\xa0 God has called them all home.\xc2\xa0 For those of us who remain, let us find the strength to carry on, and make our country worthy of their memory. May God bless and keep those we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost in His heavenly place.\xc2\xa0 May He grace those we still have with His holy comfort.\xc2\xa0 And may He bless and watch over this community, and the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
