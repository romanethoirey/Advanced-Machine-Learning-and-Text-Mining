b"\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, fellow citizens: \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this chamber that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my task,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto report the State of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report. \xc2\xa0After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs. \xc2\xa0We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in 20. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded. \xc2\xa0Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still can\xe2\x80\x99t find full-time employment. \xc2\xa0Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt is our generation\xe2\x80\x99s task, then, to reignite the true engine of America\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or who you love.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThe American people don\xe2\x80\x99t expect government to solve every problem. \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. \xc2\xa0But they do expect us to put the nation\xe2\x80\x99s interests before party. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. \xc2\xa0For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOur work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOver the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. \xc2\xa0As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow we need to finish the job. \xc2\xa0And the question is, how?\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year. \xc2\xa0These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99d devastate priorities like education, and energy, and medical research. \xc2\xa0They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits. \xc2\xa0That idea is even worse. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nYes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population. \xc2\xa0And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We won\xe2\x80\x99t grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters. \xc2\xa0Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- understand that we can\xe2\x80\x99t just cut our way to prosperity. \xc2\xa0They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach I offer tonight. \xc2\xa0\r\nOn Medicare, I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAlready, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And the reforms I\xe2\x80\x99m proposing go even further. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they don\xe2\x80\x99t violate the guarantee of a secure retirement. \xc2\xa0Our government shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTo hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected. \xc2\xa0After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks? \xc2\xa0How is that fair? \xc2\xa0Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes? \xc2\xa0How does that promote growth? \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We can get this done. \xc2\xa0The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring -- a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants can\xe2\x80\x99t work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what tax reform can deliver. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what we can do together. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy. \xc2\xa0The politics will be hard for both sides. \xc2\xa0None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. \xc2\xa0But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. \xc2\xa0And let\xe2\x80\x99s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We can't do it. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s agree right here, right now to keep the people\xe2\x80\x99s government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda. \xc2\xa0But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: \xc2\xa0How do we attract more jobs to our shores? \xc2\xa0How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs? \xc2\xa0And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nA year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs. \xc2\xa0And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda. \xc2\xa0I urge this Congress to pass the rest. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0But tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago. \xc2\xa0Let me repeat -- nothing I\xe2\x80\x99m proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime. \xc2\xa0It is not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That's what we should be looking for.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOur first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing. \xc2\xa0After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three. \xc2\xa0Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan. \xc2\xa0Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico. \xc2\xa0And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThere are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend. \xc2\xa0Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio. \xc2\xa0A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason this can\xe2\x80\x99t happen in other towns. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs. \xc2\xa0And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America. \xc2\xa0We can get that done. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas. \xc2\xa0Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy -- every dollar. \xc2\xa0Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful. \xc2\xa0Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation. \xc2\xa0Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race. \xc2\xa0We need to make those investments. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\nToday, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy. \xc2\xa0After years of talking about it, we\xe2\x80\x99re finally poised to control our own energy future. \xc2\xa0We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it. \xc2\xa0We produce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyone\xe2\x80\x99s energy bill is lower because of it. \xc2\xa0And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s true that no single event makes a trend. \xc2\xa0But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15. \xc2\xa0Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods -- all are now more frequent and more intense. \xc2\xa0We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence. \xc2\xa0Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth. \xc2\xa0I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. \xc2\xa0But if Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t act soon to protect future generations, I will. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFour years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to change that. \xc2\xa0Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s generate even more. \xc2\xa0Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- let\xe2\x80\x99s drive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence. \xc2\xa0We need to encourage that. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan. \xc2\xa0But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together. \xc2\xa0So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good. \xc2\xa0If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices we\xe2\x80\x99ve put up with for far too long. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m also issuing a new goal for America: \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We'll work with the states to do it. \xc2\xa0Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair. \xc2\xa0Ask any CEO where they\xe2\x80\x99d rather locate and hire -- a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools, self-healing power grids. \xc2\xa0The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, they\xe2\x80\x99ll bring even more jobs. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world. \xc2\xa0And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen all those ribbon-cuttings. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo tonight, I propose a \xe2\x80\x9cFix-It-First\xe2\x80\x9d program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. (Applause.) \xc2\xa0And to make sure taxpayers don\xe2\x80\x99t shoulder the whole burden, I\xe2\x80\x99m also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most: \xc2\xa0modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s prove that there\xe2\x80\x99s no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and let\xe2\x80\x99s start right away. \xc2\xa0We can get this done.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector. \xc2\xa0The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007. \xc2\xa0Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years. \xc2\xa0Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected. \xc2\xa0Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s holding our entire economy back. \xc2\xa0We need to fix it. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nRight now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at today\xe2\x80\x99s rates. \xc2\xa0Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Why would we be against that? \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance? \xc2\xa0Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s holding us back? \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s streamline the process, and help our economy grow.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThese initiatives in manufacturing, energy, infrastructure, housing -- all these things will help entrepreneurs and small business owners expand and create new jobs. \xc2\xa0But none of it will matter unless we also equip our citizens with the skills and training to fill those jobs. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd that has to start at the earliest possible age. \xc2\xa0Study after study shows that the sooner a child begins learning, the better he or she does down the road. \xc2\xa0But today, fewer than 3 in 10 four year-olds are enrolled in a high-quality preschool program. \xc2\xa0Most middle-class parents can\xe2\x80\x99t afford a few hundred bucks a week for a private preschool. \xc2\xa0And for poor kids who need help the most, this lack of access to preschool education can shadow them for the rest of their lives. \xc2\xa0So tonight, I propose working with states to make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That's something we should be able to do. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nEvery dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than seven dollars later on -- by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime. \xc2\xa0In states that make it a priority to educate our youngest children, like Georgia or Oklahoma, studies show students grow up more likely to read and do math at grade level, graduate high school, hold a job, form more stable families of their own. \xc2\xa0We know this works. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s do what works and make sure none of our children start the race of life already behind. Let\xe2\x80\x99s give our kids that chance. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s also make sure that a high school diploma puts our kids on a path to a good job. \xc2\xa0Right now, countries like Germany focus on graduating their high school students with the equivalent of a technical degree from one of our community colleges. \xc2\xa0So those German kids, they're ready for a job when they graduate high school. \xc2\xa0They've been trained for the jobs that are there. \xc2\xa0Now at schools like P-Tech in Brooklyn, a collaboration between New York Public Schools and City University of New York and IBM, students will graduate with a high school diploma and an associate's degree in computers or engineering. \xc2\xa0\r\nWe need to give every American student opportunities like this. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd four years ago, we started Race to the Top -- a competition that convinced almost every state to develop smarter curricula and higher standards, all for about 1 percent of what we spend on education each year. \xc2\xa0Tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing a new challenge to redesign America\xe2\x80\x99s high schools so they better equip graduates for the demands of a high-tech economy. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll reward schools that develop new partnerships with colleges and employers, and create classes that focus on science, technology, engineering and math -- the skills today\xe2\x80\x99s employers are looking for to fill the jobs that are there right now and will be there in the future.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, even with better high schools, most young people will need some higher education. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple fact the more education you\xe2\x80\x99ve got, the more likely you are to have a good job and work your way into the middle class. \xc2\xa0But today, skyrocketing costs price too many young people out of a higher education, or saddle them with unsustainable debt.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThrough tax credits, grants and better loans, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made college more affordable for millions of students and families over the last few years. \xc2\xa0But taxpayers can\xe2\x80\x99t keep on subsidizing higher and higher and higher costs for higher education. \xc2\xa0Colleges must do their part to keep costs down, and it\xe2\x80\x99s our job to make sure that they do. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo tonight, I ask Congress to change the Higher Education Act so that affordability and value are included in determining which colleges receive certain types of federal aid. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) And tomorrow, my administration will release a new \xe2\x80\x9cCollege Scorecard\xe2\x80\x9d that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria -- where you can get the most bang for your educational buck. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, to grow our middle class, our citizens have to have access to the education and training that today\xe2\x80\x99s jobs require. \xc2\xa0But we also have to make sure that America remains a place where everyone who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to work -- everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to work hard has the chance to get ahead.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOur economy is stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And right now, leaders from the business, labor, law enforcement, faith communities -- they all agree that the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Now is the time to do it. \xc2\xa0Now is the time to get it done. \xc2\xa0Now is the time to get it done. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nReal reform means strong border security, and we can build on the progress my administration has already made -- putting more boots on the Southern border than at any time in our history and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nReal reform means establishing a responsible pathway to earned citizenship -- a path that includes passing a background check, paying taxes and a meaningful penalty, learning English, and going to the back of the line behind the folks trying to come here legally. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd real reform means fixing the legal immigration system to cut waiting periods and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers that will help create jobs and grow our economy. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn other words, we know what needs to be done. \xc2\xa0And as we speak, bipartisan groups in both chambers are working diligently to draft a bill, and I applaud their efforts. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s get this done. \xc2\xa0Send me a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the next few months, and I will sign it right away. \xc2\xa0And America will be better for it. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. \xc2\xa0We know our economy is stronger when our wives, our mothers, our daughters can live their lives free from discrimination in the workplace, and free from the fear of domestic violence. \xc2\xa0Today, the Senate passed the Violence Against Women Act that Joe Biden originally wrote almost 20 years ago. \xc2\xa0And I now urge the House to do the same. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Good job, Joe. \xc2\xa0And I ask this Congress to declare that women should earn a living equal to their efforts, and finally pass the Paycheck Fairness Act this year. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe know our economy is stronger when we reward an honest day\xe2\x80\x99s work with honest wages. \xc2\xa0But today, a full-time worker making the minimum wage earns $14,500 a year. \xc2\xa0Even with the tax relief we put in place, a family with two kids that earns the minimum wage still lives below the poverty line. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why, since the last time this Congress raised the minimum wage, 19 states have chosen to bump theirs even higher.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTonight, let\xe2\x80\x99s declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty, and raise the federal minimum wage to $9.00 an hour. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) We should be able to get that done. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThis single step would raise the incomes of millions of working families. \xc2\xa0It could mean the difference between groceries or the food bank; rent or eviction; scraping by or finally getting ahead. \xc2\xa0For businesses across the country, it would mean customers with more money in their pockets. \xc2\xa0And a whole lot of folks out there would probably need less help from government. \xc2\xa0In fact, working folks shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait year after year for the minimum wage to go up while CEO pay has never been higher. \xc2\xa0So here\xe2\x80\x99s an idea that Governor Romney and I actually agreed on last year -- let\xe2\x80\x99s tie the minimum wage to the cost of living, so that it finally becomes a wage you can live on. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTonight, let\xe2\x80\x99s also recognize that there are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead. \xc2\xa0Factory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. \xc2\xa0Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. \xc2\xa0America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s offer incentives to companies that hire Americans who\xe2\x80\x99ve got what it takes to fill that job opening, but have been out of work so long that no one will give them a chance anymore. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in run-down neighborhoods. \xc2\xa0And this year, my administration will begin to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit towns in America to get these communities back on their feet. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll work with local leaders to target resources at public safety, and education, and housing. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give new tax credits to businesses that hire and invest. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and do more to encourage fatherhood -- because what makes you a man isn\xe2\x80\x99t the ability to conceive a child; it\xe2\x80\x99s having the courage to raise one. \xc2\xa0And we want to encourage that. \xc2\xa0We want to help that. (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nStronger families. \xc2\xa0Stronger communities. \xc2\xa0A stronger America. \xc2\xa0It is this kind of prosperity -- broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class -- that has always been the source of our progress at home. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTonight, we stand united in saluting the troops and civilians who sacrifice every day to protect us. \xc2\xa0Because of them, we can say with confidence that America will complete its mission in Afghanistan and achieve our objective of defeating the core of al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAlready, we have brought home 33,000 of our brave servicemen and women. \xc2\xa0This spring, our forces will move into a support role, while Afghan security forces take the lead. \xc2\xa0Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0This drawdown will continue and by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBeyond 2014, America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to a unified and sovereign Afghanistan will endure, but the nature of our commitment will change. \xc2\xa0We're negotiating an agreement with the Afghan government that focuses on two missions -- training and equipping Afghan forces so that the country does not again slip into chaos, and counterterrorism efforts that allow us to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda and their affiliates.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nToday, the organization that attacked us on 9/11 is a shadow of its former self. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0It's true, different al Qaeda affiliates and extremist groups have emerged -- from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa. \xc2\xa0The threat these groups pose is evolving. \xc2\xa0But to meet this threat, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to send tens of thousands of our sons and daughters abroad or occupy other nations. \xc2\xa0Instead, we'll need to help countries like Yemen, and Libya, and Somalia provide for their own security, and help allies who take the fight to terrorists, as we have in Mali. \xc2\xa0And where necessary, through a range of capabilities, we will continue to take direct action against those terrorists who pose the gravest threat to Americans. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, as we do, we must enlist our values in the fight. \xc2\xa0That's why my administration has worked tirelessly to forge a durable legal and policy framework to guide our counterterrorism efforts. \xc2\xa0Throughout, we have kept Congress fully informed of our efforts. \xc2\xa0I recognize that in our democracy, no one should just take my word for it that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing things the right way. \xc2\xa0So in the months ahead, I will continue to engage Congress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOf course, our challenges don\xe2\x80\x99t end with al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0America will continue to lead the effort to prevent the spread of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous weapons. \xc2\xa0The regime in North Korea must know they will only achieve security and prosperity by meeting their international obligations. \xc2\xa0Provocations of the sort we saw last night will only further isolate them, as we stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLikewise, the leaders of Iran must recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet their obligations, and we will do what is necessary to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAt the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands -- because our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAmerica must also face the rapidly growing threat from cyber-attacks. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Now, we know hackers steal people\xe2\x80\x99s identities and infiltrate private emails. \xc2\xa0We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets. \xc2\xa0Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, our air traffic control systems. \xc2\xa0We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why, earlier today, I signed a new executive order that will strengthen our cyber defenses by increasing information sharing, and developing standards to protect our national security, our jobs, and our privacy. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut now Congress must act as well, by passing legislation to give our government a greater capacity to secure our networks and deter attacks. \xc2\xa0This is something we should be able to get done on a bipartisan basis. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, even as we protect our people, we should remember that today\xe2\x80\x99s world presents not just dangers, not just threats, it presents opportunities. \xc2\xa0To boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia, we intend to complete negotiations on a Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0And tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union -- because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe also know that progress in the most impoverished parts of our world enriches us all -- not only because it creates new markets, more stable order in certain regions of the world, but also because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do. \xc2\xa0In many places, people live on little more than a dollar a day. \xc2\xa0So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades by connecting more people to the global economy; by empowering women; by giving our young and brightest minds new opportunities to serve, and helping communities to feed, and power, and educate themselves; by saving the world\xe2\x80\x99s children from preventable deaths; and by realizing the promise of an AIDS-free generation, which is within our reach. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nYou see, America must remain a beacon to all who seek freedom during this period of historic change. \xc2\xa0I saw the power of hope last year in Rangoon, in Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi welcomed an American President into the home where she had been imprisoned for years; when thousands of Burmese lined the streets, waving American flags, including a man who said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is justice and law in the United States. \xc2\xa0I want our country to be like that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn defense of freedom, we\xe2\x80\x99ll remain the anchor of strong alliances from the Americas to Africa; from Europe to Asia. \xc2\xa0In the Middle East, we will stand with citizens as they demand their universal rights, and support stable transitions to democracy. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe know the process will be messy, and we cannot presume to dictate the course of change in countries like Egypt, but we can -- and will -- insist on respect for the fundamental rights of all people. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the pressure on a Syrian regime that has murdered its own people, and support opposition leaders that respect the rights of every Syrian. \xc2\xa0And we will stand steadfast with Israel in pursuit of security and a lasting peace. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThese are the messages I'll deliver when I travel to the Middle East next month. \xc2\xa0And all this work depends on the courage and sacrifice of those who serve in dangerous places at great personal risk \xe2\x80\x93- our diplomats, our intelligence officers, and the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. \xc2\xa0As long as I\xe2\x80\x99m Commander-in-Chief, we will do whatever we must to protect those who serve their country abroad, and we will maintain the best military the world has ever known. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe'll invest in new capabilities, even as we reduce waste and wartime spending. \xc2\xa0We will ensure equal treatment for all servicemembers, and equal benefits for their families -- gay and straight. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We will draw upon the courage and skills of our sisters and daughters and moms, because women have proven under fire that they are ready for combat. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe will keep faith with our veterans, investing in world-class care, including mental health care, for our wounded warriors -- (applause) -- supporting our military families; giving our veterans the benefits and education and job opportunities that they have earned. \xc2\xa0And I want to thank my wife, Michelle, and Dr. Jill Biden for their continued dedication to serving our military families as well as they have served us. Thank you, honey. \xc2\xa0Thank you, Jill. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nDefending our freedom, though, is not just the job of our military alone. \xc2\xa0We must all do our part to make sure our God-given rights are protected here at home. \xc2\xa0That includes one of the most fundamental right of a democracy: \xc2\xa0the right to vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0When any American, no matter where they live or what their party, are denied that right because they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to wait for five or six or seven hours just to cast their ballot, we are betraying our ideals. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing a nonpartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America. \xc2\xa0And it definitely needs improvement. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking two long-time experts in the field -- who, by the way, recently served as the top attorneys for my campaign and for Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s campaign -- to lead it. \xc2\xa0We can fix this, and we will. \xc2\xa0The American people demand it, and so does our democracy. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOf course, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said tonight matters little if we don\xe2\x80\x99t come together to protect our most precious resource: \xc2\xa0our children. \xc2\xa0It has been two months since Newtown. \xc2\xa0I know this is not the first time this country has debated how to reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0But this time is different. \xc2\xa0Overwhelming majorities of Americans -- Americans who believe in the Second Amendment -- have come together around common-sense reform, like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Senators of both parties are working together on tough new laws to prevent anyone from buying guns for resale to criminals. \xc2\xa0Police chiefs are asking our help to get weapons of war and massive ammunition magazines off our streets, because these police chiefs, they\xe2\x80\x99re tired of seeing their guys and gals being outgunned. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nEach of these proposals deserves a vote in Congress. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Now, if you want to vote no, that\xe2\x80\x99s your choice. \xc2\xa0But these proposals deserve a vote. \xc2\xa0Because in the two months since Newtown, more than a thousand birthdays, graduations, anniversaries have been stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun -- more than a thousand.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOne of those we lost was a young girl named Hadiya Pendleton. \xc2\xa0She was 15 years old. \xc2\xa0She loved Fig Newtons and lip gloss. \xc2\xa0She was a majorette. \xc2\xa0She was so good to her friends they all thought they were her best friend. \xc2\xa0Just three weeks ago, she was here, in Washington, with her classmates, performing for her country at my inauguration. \xc2\xa0And a week later, she was shot and killed in a Chicago park after school, just a mile away from my house.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nHadiya\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Nate and Cleo, are in this chamber tonight, along with more than two dozen Americans whose lives have been torn apart by gun violence. \xc2\xa0They deserve a vote. \xc2\xa0They deserve a vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Gabby Giffords deserves a vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0The families of Newtown deserve a vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) The families of Aurora deserve a vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0The families of Oak Creek and Tucson and Blacksburg, and the countless other communities ripped open by gun violence \xe2\x80\x93- they deserve a simple vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0They deserve a simple vote. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOur actions will not prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. \xc2\xa0In fact, no laws, no initiatives, no administrative acts will perfectly solve all the challenges I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined tonight. \xc2\xa0But we were never sent here to be perfect. \xc2\xa0We were sent here to make what difference we can, to secure this nation, expand opportunity, uphold our ideals through the hard, often frustrating, but absolutely necessary work of self-government.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe were sent here to look out for our fellow Americans the same way they look out for one another, every single day, usually without fanfare, all across this country. \xc2\xa0We should follow their example.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe should follow the example of a New York City nurse named Menchu Sanchez. \xc2\xa0When Hurricane Sandy plunged her hospital into darkness, she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking about how her own home was faring. Her mind was on the 20 precious newborns in her care and the rescue plan she devised that kept them all safe.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe should follow the example of a North Miami woman named Desiline Victor. \xc2\xa0When Desiline arrived at her polling place, she was told the wait to vote might be six hours. \xc2\xa0And as time ticked by, her concern was not with her tired body or aching feet, but whether folks like her would get to have their say. \xc2\xa0And hour after hour, a throng of people stayed in line to support her -- because Desiline is 102 years old. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And they erupted in cheers when she finally put on a sticker that read, \xe2\x80\x9cI voted.\xe2\x80\x9d (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe should follow the example of a police officer named Brian Murphy. \xc2\xa0When a gunman opened fire on a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and Brian was the first to arrive, he did not consider his own safety. \xc2\xa0He fought back until help arrived and ordered his fellow officers to protect the safety of the Americans worshiping inside, even as he lay bleeding from 12 bullet wounds. \xc2\xa0And when asked how he did that, Brian said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the way we\xe2\x80\x99re made.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s just the way we\xe2\x80\x99re made. \xc2\xa0We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us. \xc2\xa0But as Americans, we all share the same proud title -- we are citizens. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a word that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just describe our nationality or legal status. \xc2\xa0It describes the way we\xe2\x80\x99re made. \xc2\xa0It describes what we believe. \xc2\xa0It captures the enduring idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations, that our rights are wrapped up in the rights of others; and that well into our third century as a nation, it remains the task of us all, as citizens of these United States, to be the authors of the next great chapter of our American story. \xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThank you. \xc2\xa0God bless you, and God bless these United States of America. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0"
