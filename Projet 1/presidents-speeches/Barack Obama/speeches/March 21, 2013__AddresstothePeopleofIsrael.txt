b'Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much. Well, it is a great honor to be with you here in Jerusalem, and I\xe2\x80\x99m so grateful for the welcome that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received from the people of Israel.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I bring with me the support of the American people -- (applause) -- and the friendship that binds us together.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOver the last two days, I\xe2\x80\x99ve reaffirmed the bonds between our countries with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Peres. I\xe2\x80\x99ve borne witness to the ancient history of the Jewish people at the Shrine of the Book, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Israel\xe2\x80\x99s shining future in your scientists and your entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 This is a nation of museums and patents, timeless holy sites and ground-breaking innovation.\xc2\xa0 Only in Israel could you see the Dead Sea Scrolls and the place where the technology on board the Mars Rover originated at the same time.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) But what I\xe2\x80\x99ve most looked forward to is the ability to speak directly to you, the Israeli people -- especially so many young people who are here today -- (applause) -- to talk about the history that brought us here today, and the future that you will make in the years to come.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, I know that in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s vibrant democracy, every word, every gesture is carefully scrutinized.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I want to clear something up just so you know -- any drama between me and my friend, Bibi, over the years was just a plot to create material for Eretz Nehederet.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that was going on.\xc2\xa0 We just wanted to make sure the writers had good material.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I also know that I come to Israel on the eve of a sacred holiday -- the celebration of Passover.\xc2\xa0 And that is where I would like to begin today.\xc2\xa0 Just a few days from now, Jews here in Israel and around the world will sit with family and friends at the Seder table, and celebrate with songs, wine and symbolic foods.\xc2\xa0 After enjoying Seders with family and friends in Chicago and on the campaign trail, I\xe2\x80\x99m proud that I\'ve now brought this tradition into the White House.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I did so because I wanted my daughters to experience the Haggadah, and the story at the center of Passover that makes this time of year so powerful.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a story of centuries of slavery, and years of wandering in the desert; a story of perseverance amidst persecution, and faith in God and the Torah.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a story about finding freedom in your own land.\xc2\xa0 And for the Jewish people, this story is central to who you\xe2\x80\x99ve become.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a story that holds within it the universal human experience, with all of its suffering, but also all of its salvation. It\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the three great religions -- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- that trace their origins to Abraham, and see Jerusalem as sacred.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a story that\xe2\x80\x99s inspired communities across the globe, including me and my fellow Americans.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn the United States -- a nation made up of people who crossed oceans to start anew -- we\xe2\x80\x99re naturally drawn to the idea of finding freedom in our land.\xc2\xa0 To African Americans, the story of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most powerful image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity -- a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today.\xc2\xa0 For generations, this promise helped people weather poverty and persecution, while holding on to the hope that a better day was on the horizon.\xc2\xa0 For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Of course, even as we draw strength from the story of God\xe2\x80\x99s will and His gift of freedom expressed on Passover, we also know that here on Earth we must bear our responsibilities in an imperfect world.\xc2\xa0 That means accepting our measure of sacrifice and struggle, just like previous generations.\xc2\xa0 It means us working through generation after generation on behalf of that ideal of freedom.\xc2\xa0 As Dr. Martin Luther King said on the day before he was killed, \xe2\x80\x9cI may not get there with you.\xc2\xa0 But I want you to know that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 So just as Joshua carried on after Moses, the work goes on for all of you, the Joshua Generation, for justice and dignity; for opportunity and freedom.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFor the Jewish people, the journey to the promise of the State of Israel wound through countless generations.\xc2\xa0 It involved centuries of suffering and exile, prejudice and pogroms and even genocide.\xc2\xa0 Through it all, the Jewish people sustained their unique identity and traditions, as well as a longing to return home.\xc2\xa0 And while Jews achieved extraordinary success in many parts of the world, the dream of true freedom finally found its full expression in the Zionist idea -- to be a free people in your homeland.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I believe that Israel is rooted not just in history and tradition, but also in a simple and profound idea -- the idea that people deserve to be free in a land of their own.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Over the last 65 years, when Israel has been at its best, Israelis have demonstrated that responsibility does not end when you reach the promised land, it only begins.\xc2\xa0 And so Israel has been a refuge for the diaspora -- welcoming Jews from Europe, from the former Soviet Union, from Ethiopia, from North Africa.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIsrael has built a prosperous nation -- through kibbutzeem that made the desert bloom, business that broadened the middle class, innovators who reached new frontiers, from the smallest microchip to the orbits of space.\xc2\xa0 Israel has established a thriving democracy, with a spirited civil society and proud political parties, and a tireless free press, and a lively public debate -\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9clively\xe2\x80\x9d may even be an understatement.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd Israel has achieved all this even as it\xe2\x80\x99s overcome relentless threats to its security -- through the courage of the Israel Defense Forces, and the citizenry that is so resilient in the face of terror.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThis is the story of Israel.\xc2\xa0 This is the work that has brought the dreams of so many generations to life.\xc2\xa0 And every step of the way, Israel has built unbreakable bonds of friendship with my country, the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThose ties began only 11 minutes after Israeli independence, when the United States was the first nation to recognize the State of Israel.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 As President Truman said in explaining his decision to recognize Israel, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it has a glorious future before it not just as another sovereign nation, but as an embodiment of the great ideals of our civilization.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And since then, we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a friendship that advances our shared interests.\xc2\xa0 Together, we share a commitment to security for our citizens and the stability of the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 Together, we share a focus on advancing economic growth around the globe, and strengthening the middle class within our own countries.\xc2\xa0 Together, we share a stake in the success of democracy.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut the source of our friendship extends beyond mere interests, just as it has transcended political parties and individual leaders.\xc2\xa0 America is a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 America is strengthened by diversity.\xc2\xa0 America is enriched by faith.\xc2\xa0 We are governed not simply by men and women, but by laws.\xc2\xa0 We\'re fueled by entrepreneurship and innovation, and we are defined by a democratic discourse that allows each generation to reimagine and renew our union once more.\xc2\xa0 So in Israel, we see values that we share, even as we recognize what makes us different.\xc2\xa0 That is an essential part of our bond.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, I stand here today mindful that for both our nations, these are some complicated times.\xc2\xa0 We have difficult issues to work through within our own countries, and we face dangers and upheaval around the world.\xc2\xa0 And when I look at young people within the United States, I think about the choices that they must make in their lives to define who we\'ll be as a nation in this 21st century, particularly as we emerge from two wars and the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 But part of the reason I like talking to young people is because no matter how great the challenges are, their idealism, their energy, their ambition always gives me hope.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd I see the same spirit in the young people here today.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I believe that you will shape our future.\xc2\xa0 And given the ties between our countries, I believe your future is bound to ours.\xc2\xa0 (Audience interruption.) \xc2\xa0 No, no -- this is part of the lively debate that we talked about.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This is good.\xc2\xa0 You know, I have to say we actually arranged for that, because it made me feel at home.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable if I didn\'t have at least one heckler.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to focus on how we -- and when I say "we," in particular young people -- can work together to make progress in three areas that will define our times -- security, peace and prosperity.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet me begin with security.\xc2\xa0 I\'m proud that the security relationship between the United States and Israel has never been stronger.\xc2\xa0 Never.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 More exercises between our militaries; more exchanges among our political and military and intelligence officials than ever before; the largest program to date to help you retain your qualitative military edge.\xc2\xa0 These are the facts.\xc2\xa0 These aren\'t my opinions, these are facts.\xc2\xa0 But, to me, this is not simply measured on a balance sheet.\xc2\xa0 I know that here, in Israel, security is something personal. Here\'s what I think about when I consider these issues.\xc2\xa0 When I consider Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, I think about children like Osher Twito, who I met in Sderot -- (applause) -- children the same age as my own daughters who went to bed at night fearful that a rocket would land in their bedroom simply because of who they are and where they live.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That reality is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve invested in the Iron Dome system to save countless lives -- because those children deserve to sleep better at night.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear, time and again, that Israel cannot accept rocket attacks from Gaza, and we have stood up for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to defend itself.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Israel has a right to expect Hamas to renounce violence and recognize Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist. (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWhen I think about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, I think about five Israelis who boarded a bus in Bulgaria, who were blown up because of where they came from; robbed of the ability to live, and love, and raise families.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why every country that values justice should call Hizbollah what it truly is -- a terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Because the world cannot tolerate an organization that murders innocent civilians, stockpiles rockets to shoot at cities, and supports the massacre of men and women and children in Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) The fact that Hizbollah\xe2\x80\x99s ally -- the Assad regime -- has stockpiles of chemical weapons only heightens the urgency.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to cooperate closely to guard against that danger. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear to Bashar al-Assad and all who follow his orders:\xc2\xa0 We will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people, or the transfer of those weapons to terrorists.\xc2\xa0 The world is watching; we will hold you accountable. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people have the right to be freed from the grip of a dictator who would rather kill his own people than relinquish power.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Assad must go so that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future can begin.\xc2\xa0 Because true stability in Syria depends upon establishing a government that is responsible to its people -- one that protects all communities within its borders, while making peace with countries beyond them.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThese are the things I think about when I think about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xc2\xa0 When I consider Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, I also think about a people who have a living memory of the Holocaust, faced with the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iranian government that has called for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s destruction.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder Israelis view this as an existential threat.\xc2\xa0 But this is not simply a challenge for Israel -- it is a danger for the entire world, including the United States.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 A nuclear-armed Iran would raise the risk of nuclear terrorism.\xc2\xa0 It would undermine the non-proliferation regime.\xc2\xa0 It would spark an arms race in a volatile region.\xc2\xa0 And it would embolden a government that has shown no respect for the rights of its own people or the responsibilities of nations.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s why America has built a coalition to increase the cost to Iran of failing to meet their obligations.\xc2\xa0 The Iranian government is now under more pressure than ever before, and that pressure is increasing.\xc2\xa0 It is isolated.\xc2\xa0 Its economy is in dire straits.\xc2\xa0 Its leadership is divided.\xc2\xa0 And its position -- in the region, and the world -- has only grown weaker.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI do believe that all of us have an interest in resolving this issue peacefully.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Strong and principled diplomacy is the best way to ensure that the Iranian government forsakes nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Peace is far more preferable to war.\xc2\xa0 And the inevitable costs, the unintended consequences that would come with war means that we have to do everything we can to try to resolve this diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 Because of the cooperation between our governments, we know that there remains time to pursue a diplomatic resolution.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what America will do, with clear eyes -- working with a world that\xe2\x80\x99s united, and with the sense of urgency that\xe2\x80\x99s required.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut Iran must know this time is not unlimited.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve made the position of the United States of America clear:\xc2\xa0 Iran must not get a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 This is not a danger that can be contained, and as President, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said all options are on the table for achieving our objectives.\xc2\xa0 America will do what we must to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFor young Israelis, I know that these issues of security are rooted in an experience that is even more fundamental than the pressing threat of the day.\xc2\xa0 You live in a neighborhood where many of your neighbors have rejected the right of your nation to exist.\xc2\xa0 Your grandparents had to risk their lives and all that they had to make a place for themselves in this world.\xc2\xa0 Your parents lived through war after war to ensure the survival of the Jewish state.\xc2\xa0 Your children grow up knowing that people they\xe2\x80\x99ve never met may hate them because of who they are, in a region that is full of turmoil and changing underneath your feet.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what I think about when Israel is faced with these challenges \xe2\x80\x93- that sense of an Israel that is surrounded by many in this region who still reject it, and many in the world who refuse to accept it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the security of the Jewish people in Israel is so important.\xc2\xa0 It cannot be taken for granted.\xc2\xa0 But make no mistake -- those who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist, they might as well reject the earth beneath them or the sky above, because Israel is not going anywhere.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And today, I want to tell you -- particularly the young people -- so that there\'s no mistake here, so long as there is a United States of America -- Atem lo levad. You are not alone.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThe question is what kind of future Israel will look forward to.\xc2\xa0 Israel is not going anywhere -- but especially for the young people in this audience, the question is what does its future hold?\xc2\xa0 And that brings me to the subject of peace.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I know Israel has taken risks for peace.\xc2\xa0 Brave leaders -- Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin -- reached treaties with two of your neighbors.\xc2\xa0 You made credible proposals to the Palestinians at Annapolis.\xc2\xa0 You withdrew from Gaza and Lebanon, and then faced terror and rockets.\xc2\xa0 Across the region, you\xe2\x80\x99ve extended a hand of friendship and all too often you\xe2\x80\x99ve been confronted with rejection and, in some cases, the ugly reality of anti-Semitism. So I believe that the Israeli people do want peace, and I also understand why too many Israelis -- maybe an increasing number, maybe a lot of young people here today -- are skeptical that it can be achieved.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut today, Israel is at a crossroads.\xc2\xa0 It can be tempting to put aside the frustrations and sacrifices that come with the pursuit of peace, particularly when Iron Dome repels rockets, barriers keep out suicide bombers.\xc2\xa0 There\'s so many other pressing issues that demand your attention.\xc2\xa0 And I know that only Israelis can make the fundamental decisions about your country\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I recognize that. I also know, by the way, that not everyone in this hall will agree with what I have to say about peace.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that there are those who are not simply skeptical about peace, but question its underlying premise, have a different vision for Israel\'s future.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of a democracy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of the discourse between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that.\xc2\xa0 But I also believe it\'s important to be open and honest, especially with your friends.\xc2\xa0 I also believe that.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Politically, given the strong bipartisan support for Israel in America, the easiest thing for me to do would be to put this issue aside -- just express unconditional support for whatever Israel decides to do -- that would be the easiest political path. But I want you to know that I speak to you as a friend who is deeply concerned and committed to your future, and I ask you to consider three points.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFirst, peace is necessary.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I believe that.\xc2\xa0 I believe that peace is the only path to true security.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You have the opportunity to be the generation that permanently secures the Zionist dream, or you can face a growing challenge to its future.\xc2\xa0 Given the demographics west of the Jordan River, the only way for Israel to endure and thrive as a Jewish and democratic state is through the realization of an independent and viable Palestine.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That is true.\xc2\xa0 There are other factors involved.\xc2\xa0 Given the frustration in the international community about this conflict, Israel needs to reverse an undertow of isolation.\xc2\xa0 And given the march of technology, the only way to truly protect the Israeli people over the long term is through the absence of war.\xc2\xa0 Because no wall is high enough and no Iron Dome is strong enough or perfect enough to stop every enemy that is intent on doing so from inflicting harm.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd this truth is more pronounced given the changes sweeping the Arab world.\xc2\xa0 I understand that with the uncertainty in the region -- people in the streets, changes in leadership, the rise of non-secular parties in politics -- it\'s tempting to turn inward, because the situation outside of Israel seems so chaotic. But this is precisely the time to respond to the wave of revolution with a resolve and commitment for peace.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Because as more governments respond to popular will, the days when Israel could seek peace simply with a handful of autocratic leaders, those days are over.\xc2\xa0 Peace will have to be made among peoples, not just governments.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 No one -- no single step can change overnight what lies in the hearts and minds of millions.\xc2\xa0 No single step is going to erase years of history and propaganda.\xc2\xa0 But progress with the Palestinians is a powerful way to begin, while sidelining extremists who thrive on conflict and thrive on division.\xc2\xa0 It would make a difference.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo peace is necessary.\xc2\xa0 But peace is also just.\xc2\xa0 Peace is also just.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that Israel has faced Palestinian factions who turned to terror, leaders who missed historic opportunities.\xc2\xa0 That is all true.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why security must be at the center of any agreement.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question that the only path to peace is through negotiations -- which is why, despite the criticism we\xe2\x80\x99ve received, the United States will oppose unilateral efforts to bypass negotiations through the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 It has to be done by the parties.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But the Palestinian people\xe2\x80\x99s right to self-determination, their right to justice, must also be recognized.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Put yourself in their shoes.\xc2\xa0 Look at the world through their eyes.\xc2\xa0 It is not fair that a Palestinian child cannot grow up in a state of their own.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Living their entire lives with the presence of a foreign army that controls the movements not just of those young people but their parents, their grandparents, every single day.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just when settler violence against Palestinians goes unpunished.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands; or restricting a student\xe2\x80\x99s ability to move around the West Bank; or displace Palestinian families from their homes.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland, Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I\xe2\x80\x99m going off script here for a second, but before I came here, I met with a group of young Palestinians from the age of 15 to 22.\xc2\xa0 And talking to them, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t that different from my daughters.\xc2\xa0 They weren\xe2\x80\x99t that different from your daughters or sons.\xc2\xa0 I honestly believe that if any Israeli parent sat down with those kids, they\xe2\x80\x99d say, I want these kids to succeed; I want them to prosper.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I want them to have opportunities just like my kids do.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what Israeli parents would want for these kids if they had a chance to listen to them and talk to them.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I believe that. Now, only you can determine what kind of democracy you will have.\xc2\xa0 But remember that as you make these decisions, you will define not simply the future of your relationship with the Palestinians -- you will define the future of Israel as well.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 As Ariel Sharon said -- I\'m quoting him -- \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to have a Jewish democratic state, at the same time to control all of Eretz Israel.\xc2\xa0 If we insist on fulfilling the dream in its entirety, we are liable to lose it all.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Or, from a different perspective, I think of what the novelist David Grossman said shortly after losing his son, as he described the necessity of peace -- \xe2\x80\x9cA peace of no choice\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be approached with the same determination and creativity as one approaches a war of no choice.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, Israel cannot be expected to negotiate with anyone who is dedicated to its destruction.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But while I know you have had differences with the Palestinian Authority, I genuinely believe that you do have a true partner in President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I believe that.\xc2\xa0 And they have a track record to prove it.\xc2\xa0 Over the last few years, they have built institutions and maintained security on the West Bank in ways that few could have imagined just a few years ago.\xc2\xa0 So many Palestinians -- including young people -- have rejected violence as a means of achieving their aspirations. There is an opportunity there, there\xe2\x80\x99s a window -- which brings me to my third point:\xc2\xa0 Peace is possible.\xc2\xa0 It is possible. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I\'m not saying it\'s guaranteed.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t even say that it is more likely than not.\xc2\xa0 But it is possible.\xc2\xa0 I know it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem that way.\xc2\xa0 There are always going to be reasons to avoid risk.\xc2\xa0 There are costs for failure.\xc2\xa0 There will always be extremists who provide an excuse not to act.\xc2\xa0 I know there must be something exhausting about endless talks about talks, and daily controversies, and just the grinding status quo.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure there\'s a temptation just to say, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, enough.\xc2\xa0 Let me focus on my small corner of the world and my family and my job and what I can control.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But it\'s possible. Negotiations will be necessary, but there\'s little secret about where they must lead -- two states for two peoples.\xc2\xa0 Two states for two peoples.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) There will be differences about how to get there.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be hard choices along the way.\xc2\xa0 Arab states must adapt to a world that has changed.\xc2\xa0 The days when they could condemn Israel to distract their people from a lack of opportunity, or government corruption or mismanagement -- those days need to be over.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Now is the time for the Arab world to take steps toward normalizing relations with Israel.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nMeanwhile, Palestinians must recognize that Israel will be a Jewish state and that Israelis have the right to insist upon their security.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Israelis must recognize that continued settlement activity is counterproductive to the cause of peace, and that an independent Palestine must be viable with real borders that have to be drawn.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested principles on territory and security that I believe can be the basis for these talks.\xc2\xa0 But for the moment, put aside the plans and the process.\xc2\xa0 I ask you, instead, to think about what can be done to build trust between people.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFour years ago, I stood in Cairo in front of an audience of young people -- politically, religiously, they must seem a world away.\xc2\xa0 But the things they want, they\xe2\x80\x99re not so different from what the young people here want.\xc2\xa0 They want the ability to make their own decisions and to get an education, get a good job; to worship God in their own way; to get married; to raise a family. The same is true of those young Palestinians that I met with this morning.\xc2\xa0 The same is true for young Palestinians who yearn for a better life in Gaza.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThat\'s where peace begins -- not just in the plans of leaders, but in the hearts of people.\xc2\xa0 Not just in some carefully designed process, but in the daily connections -- that sense of empathy that takes place among those who live together in this land and in this sacred city of Jerusalem.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And let me say this as a politician -- I can promise you this, political leaders will never take risks if the people do not push them to take some risks.\xc2\xa0 You must create the change that you want to see.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know this is possible.\xc2\xa0 Look to the bridges being built in business and civil society by some of you here today.\xc2\xa0 Look at the young people who\xe2\x80\x99ve not yet learned a reason to mistrust, or those young people who\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to overcome a legacy of mistrust that they inherited from their parents, because they simply recognize that we hold more hopes in common than fears that drive us apart.\xc2\xa0 Your voices must be louder than those who would drown out hope.\xc2\xa0 Your hopes must light the way forward.\xc2\xa0 Look to a future in which Jews and Muslims and Christians can all live in peace and greater prosperity in this Holy Land.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Believe in that.\xc2\xa0 And most of all, look to the future that you want for your own children -- a future in which a Jewish, democratic, vibrant state is protected and accepted for this time and for all time.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThere will be many who say this change is not possible, but remember this -- Israel is the most powerful country in this region.\xc2\xa0 Israel has the unshakeable support of the most powerful country in the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Israel is not going anywhere. Israel has the wisdom to see the world as it is, but -- this is in your nature -- Israel also has the courage to see the world as it should be.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Ben Gurion once said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Israel, in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Sometimes, the greatest miracle is recognizing that the world can change.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a lesson that the world has learned from the Jewish people.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd that brings me to the final area that I\'ll focus on: prosperity, and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s broader role in the world.\xc2\xa0 I know that all the talk about security and peace can sometimes seem to dominate the headlines, but that\'s not where people live.\xc2\xa0 And every day, even amidst the threats that you face, Israelis are defining themselves by the opportunities that you\'re creating.\r\nThrough talent and hard work, Israelis have put this small country at the forefront of the global economy.\xc2\xa0 Israelis understand the value of education and have produced 10 Nobel laureates.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Israelis understand the power of invention, and your universities educate engineers and inventors.\xc2\xa0 And that spirit has led to economic growth and human progress -- solar power and electric cars, bandages and prosthetic limbs that save lives, stem cell research and new drugs that treat disease, cell phones and computer technology that changed the way people around the world live.\xc2\xa0 So if people want to see the future of the world economy, they should look at Tel Aviv, home to hundreds of start-ups and research centers.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Israelis are so active on social media that every day seemed to bring a different Facebook campaign about where I should give this speech.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThat innovation is just as important to the relationship between the United States and Israel as our security cooperation. Our first free trade agreement in the world was reached with Israel, nearly three decades ago.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Today the trade between our two countries is at $40 billion every year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 More importantly, that partnership is creating new products and medical treatments; it\xe2\x80\x99s pushing new frontiers of science and exploration.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of relationship that Israel should have -- and could have -- with every country in the world.\xc2\xa0 Already, we see how that innovation could reshape this region.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a program here in Jerusalem that brings together young Israelis and Palestinians to learn vital skills in technology and business.\xc2\xa0 An Israeli and Palestinian have started a venture capital fund to finance Palestinian start-ups.\xc2\xa0 Over 100 high-tech companies have found a home on the West Bank -- which speaks to the talent and entrepreneurial spirit of the Palestinian people. One of the great ironies of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the broader region is that so much of what people are yearning for -- education, entrepreneurship, the ability to start a business without paying a bribe, the ability to connect to the global economy -- those are things that can be found here in Israel. This should be a hub for thriving regional trade, and an engine for opportunity.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Israel is already a center for innovation that helps power the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that all of that potential for prosperity can be enhanced with greater security, enhanced with lasting peace.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Here, in this small strip of land that has been the center of so much of the world\xe2\x80\x99s history, so much triumph and so much tragedy, Israelis have built something that few could have imagined 65 years ago.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, I will pay tribute to that history -- at the grave of Herzl, a man who had the foresight to see the future of the Jewish people had to be reconnected to their past; at the grave of Rabin, who understood that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s victories in war had to be followed by the battles for peace; at Yad Vashem, where the world is reminded of the cloud of evil that can descend on the Jewish people and all of humanity if we ever fail to be vigilant. We bear all that history on our shoulders.\xc2\xa0 We carry all that history in our hearts.\xc2\xa0 Today, as we face the twilight of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s founding generation, you -- the young people of Israel\r\n-- must now claim its future.\xc2\xa0 It falls to you to write the next chapter in the great story of this great nation. And as the President of a country that you can count on as your greatest friend -- (applause) -- I am confident that you can help us find the promise in the days that lie ahead.\xc2\xa0 And as a man who\xe2\x80\x99s been inspired in my own life by that timeless calling within the Jewish experience -- tikkun olam -- (applause) -- I am hopeful that we can draw upon what\xe2\x80\x99s best in ourselves to meet the challenges that will come; to win the battles for peace in the wake of so much war; and to do the work of repairing this world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s your job.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my job.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the task of all of us.\xc2\xa0 May God bless you.\xc2\xa0 May God bless Israel.\xc2\xa0 May God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 Toda raba.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
