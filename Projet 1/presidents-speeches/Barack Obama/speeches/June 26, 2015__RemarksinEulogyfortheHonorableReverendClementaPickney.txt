b"THE PRESIDENT: \xc2\xa0Giving all praise and honor to God. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 The Bible calls us to hope. \xc2\xa0To persevere, and have faith in things not seen. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were still living by faith when they died,\xe2\x80\x9d Scripture tells us. \xe2\x80\x9cThey did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0 We are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith. \xc2\xa0A man who believed in things not seen. \xc2\xa0A man who believed there were better days ahead, off in the distance. \xc2\xa0A man of service who persevered, knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised, because he believed his efforts would deliver a better life for those who followed. To Jennifer, his beloved wife; to Eliana and Malana, his beautiful, wonderful daughters; to the Mother Emanuel family and the people of Charleston, the people of South Carolina. I cannot claim to have the good fortune to know Reverend Pinckney well. \xc2\xa0But I did have the pleasure of knowing him and meeting him here in South Carolina, back when we were both a little bit younger. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Back when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have visible grey hair. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0The first thing I noticed was his graciousness, his smile, his reassuring baritone, his deceptive sense of humor -- all qualities that helped him wear so effortlessly a heavy burden of expectation. Friends of his remarked this week that when Clementa Pinckney entered a room, it was like the future arrived; that even from a young age, folks knew he was special. \xc2\xa0Anointed. \xc2\xa0He was the progeny of a long line of the faithful -- a family of preachers who spread God\xe2\x80\x99s word, a family of protesters who sowed change to expand voting rights and desegregate the South. \xc2\xa0Clem heard their instruction, and he did not forsake their teaching.\xc2\xa0 He was in the pulpit by 13, pastor by 18, public servant by 23. \xc2\xa0He did not exhibit any of the cockiness of youth, nor youth\xe2\x80\x99s insecurities; instead, he set an example worthy of his position, wise beyond his years, in his speech, in his conduct, in his love, faith, and purity. \xc2\xa0 As a senator, he represented a sprawling swath of the Lowcountry, a place that has long been one of the most neglected in America. \xc2\xa0A place still wracked by poverty and inadequate schools; a place where children can still go hungry and the sick can go without treatment. \xc2\xa0A place that needed somebody like Clem. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 His position in the minority party meant the odds of winning more resources for his constituents were often long. \xc2\xa0His calls for greater equity were too often unheeded, the votes he cast were sometimes lonely. \xc2\xa0But he never gave up. \xc2\xa0He stayed true to his convictions. \xc2\xa0He would not grow discouraged. \xc2\xa0After a full day at the capitol, he\xe2\x80\x99d climb into his car and head to the church to draw sustenance from his family, from his ministry, from the community that loved and needed him. \xc2\xa0There he would fortify his faith, and imagine what might be. Reverend Pinckney embodied a politics that was neither mean, nor small. \xc2\xa0He conducted himself quietly, and kindly, and diligently. \xc2\xa0He encouraged progress not by pushing his ideas alone, but by seeking out your ideas, partnering with you to make things happen. \xc2\xa0He was full of empathy and fellow feeling, able to walk in somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s shoes and see through their eyes. \xc2\xa0No wonder one of his senate colleagues remembered Senator Pinckney as \xe2\x80\x9cthe most gentle of the 46 of us -- the best of the 46 of us.\xe2\x80\x9d Clem was often asked why he chose to be a pastor and a public servant. \xc2\xa0But the person who asked probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the history of the AME church. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0As our brothers and sisters in the AME church know, we don't make those distinctions. \xe2\x80\x9cOur calling,\xe2\x80\x9d Clem once said, \xe2\x80\x9cis not just within the walls of the congregation, but\xe2\x80\xa6the life and community in which our congregation resides.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 He embodied the idea that our Christian faith demands deeds and not just words; that the \xe2\x80\x9csweet hour of prayer\xe2\x80\x9d actually lasts the whole week long -- (applause) -- that to put our faith in action is more than individual salvation, it's about our collective salvation; that to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and house the homeless is not just a call for isolated charity but the imperative of a just society. What a good man. \xc2\xa0Sometimes I think that's the best thing to hope for when you're eulogized -- after all the words and recitations and resumes are read, to just say someone was a good man. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be of high station to be a good man. \xc2\xa0Preacher by 13. \xc2\xa0Pastor by 18. \xc2\xa0Public servant by 23. \xc2\xa0What a life Clementa Pinckney lived. \xc2\xa0What an example he set. \xc2\xa0What a model for his faith. \xc2\xa0And then to lose him at 41 -- slain in his sanctuary with eight wonderful members of his flock, each at different stages in life but bound together by a common commitment to God. \xc2\xa0 Cynthia Hurd. \xc2\xa0Susie Jackson. \xc2\xa0Ethel Lance. \xc2\xa0DePayne Middleton-Doctor. \xc2\xa0Tywanza Sanders. \xc2\xa0Daniel L. Simmons. \xc2\xa0Sharonda Coleman-Singleton. \xc2\xa0Myra Thompson. \xc2\xa0Good people. \xc2\xa0Decent people. God-fearing people. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0People so full of life and so full of kindness. \xc2\xa0People who ran the race, who persevered. \xc2\xa0People of great faith. To the families of the fallen, the nation shares in your grief. \xc2\xa0Our pain cuts that much deeper because it happened in a church. \xc2\xa0The church is and always has been the center of African-American life -- (applause) -- a place to call our own in a too often hostile world, a sanctuary from so many hardships. \xc2\xa0 Over the course of centuries, black churches served as \xe2\x80\x9chush harbors\xe2\x80\x9d where slaves could worship in safety; praise houses where their free descendants could gather and shout hallelujah -- (applause) -- rest stops for the weary along the Underground Railroad; bunkers for the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement. \xc2\xa0They have been, and continue to be, community centers where we organize for jobs and justice; places of scholarship and network; places where children are loved and fed and kept out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, and told that they are beautiful and smart -- (applause) -- and taught that they matter. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what happens in church. \xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the black church means. \xc2\xa0Our beating heart. \xc2\xa0The place where our dignity as a people is inviolate. \xc2\xa0When there\xe2\x80\x99s no better example of this tradition than Mother Emanuel -- (applause) -- a church built by blacks seeking liberty, burned to the ground because its founder sought to end slavery, only to rise up again, a Phoenix from these ashes. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0 When there were laws banning all-black church gatherings, services happened here anyway, in defiance of unjust laws. \xc2\xa0When there was a righteous movement to dismantle Jim Crow, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. preached from its pulpit, and marches began from its steps. \xc2\xa0A sacred place, this church. \xc2\xa0Not just for blacks, not just for Christians, but for every American who cares about the steady expansion -- (applause) -- of human rights and human dignity in this country; a foundation stone for liberty and justice for all. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what the church meant. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do not know whether the killer of Reverend Pinckney and eight others knew all of this history. \xc2\xa0But he surely sensed the meaning of his violent act. \xc2\xa0It was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots fired at churches, not random, but as a means of control, a way to terrorize and oppress. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0An act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination; violence and suspicion. \xc2\xa0An act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s original sin.\r\n\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nOh, but God works in mysterious ways. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0God has different ideas. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was being used by God. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Blinded by hatred, the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group -- the light of love that shone as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer circle. \xc2\xa0The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court -- in the midst of unspeakable grief, with words of forgiveness. \xc2\xa0He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 The alleged killer could not imagine how the city of Charleston, under the good and wise leadership of Mayor Riley -- (applause) -- how the state of South Carolina, how the United States of America would respond -- not merely with revulsion at his evil act, but with big-hearted generosity and, more importantly, with a thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life. Blinded by hatred, he failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood -- the power of God\xe2\x80\x99s grace. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 This whole week, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reflecting on this idea of grace. (Applause.) \xc2\xa0The grace of the families who lost loved ones. \xc2\xa0The grace that Reverend Pinckney would preach about in his sermons. \xc2\xa0The grace described in one of my favorite hymnals -- the one we all know: \xc2\xa0Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0I once was lost, but now I\xe2\x80\x99m found; was blind but now I see. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 According to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. \xc2\xa0Grace is not merited. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not something we deserve. \xc2\xa0Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God -- (applause) -- as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings. \xc2\xa0Grace. \xc2\xa0 As a nation, out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us, for he has allowed us to see where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been blind. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0He has given us the chance, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been lost, to find our best selves. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We may not have earned it, this grace, with our rancor and complacency, and short-sightedness and fear of each other -- but we got it all the same. \xc2\xa0He gave it to us anyway. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s once more given us grace. \xc2\xa0But it is up to us now to make the most of it, to receive it with gratitude, and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift. For too long, we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s true, a flag did not cause these murders. \xc2\xa0But as people from all walks of life, Republicans and Democrats, now acknowledge -- including Governor Haley, whose recent eloquence on the subject is worthy of praise -- (applause) -- as we all have to acknowledge, the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. \xc2\xa0We see that now. \xc2\xa0 Removing the flag from this state\xe2\x80\x99s capitol would not be an act of political correctness; it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers. \xc2\xa0It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought -- the cause of slavery -- was wrong -- (applause) -- the imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War, the resistance to civil rights for all people was wrong. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) It would be one step in an honest accounting of America\xe2\x80\x99s history; a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds. \xc2\xa0It would be an expression of the amazing changes that have transformed this state and this country for the better, because of the work of so many people of goodwill, people of all races striving to form a more perfect union. \xc2\xa0By taking down that flag, we express God\xe2\x80\x99s grace. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 But I don't think God wants us to stop there. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0For too long, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. \xc2\xa0Perhaps we see that now. \xc2\xa0Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty, or attend dilapidated schools, or grow up without prospects for a job or for a career. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Perhaps it causes us to examine what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to cause some of our children to hate. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Perhaps it softens hearts towards those lost young men, tens and tens of thousands caught up in the criminal justice system -- (applause) -- and leads us to make sure that that system is not infected with bias; that we embrace changes in how we train and equip our police so that the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve make us all safer and more secure. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Maybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we don't realize it, so that we're guarding against not just racial slurs, but we're also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0So that we search our hearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0By recognizing our common humanity by treating every child as important, regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born, and to do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to make opportunity real for every American -- by doing that, we express God\xe2\x80\x99s grace. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 For too long -- AUDIENCE: \xc2\xa0For too long! THE PRESIDENT: \xc2\xa0For too long, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) Sporadically, our eyes are open: \xc2\xa0When eight of our brothers and sisters are cut down in a church basement, 12 in a movie theater, 26 in an elementary school. \xc2\xa0But I hope we also see the 30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every single day; the countless more whose lives are forever changed -- the survivors crippled, the children traumatized and fearful every day as they walk to school, the husband who will never feel his wife\xe2\x80\x99s warm touch, the entire communities whose grief overflows every time they have to watch what happened to them happen to some other place. \xc2\xa0 The vast majority of Americans -- the majority of gun owners -- want to do something about this. \xc2\xa0We see that now. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And I'm convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others, even as we respect the traditions and ways of life that make up this beloved country -- by making the moral choice to change, we express God\xe2\x80\x99s grace. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t earn grace. \xc2\xa0We're all sinners. \xc2\xa0We don't deserve it. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0But God gives it to us anyway. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And we choose how to receive it. \xc2\xa0It's our decision how to honor it. \xc2\xa0 None of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight. \xc2\xa0Every time something like this happens, somebody says we have to have a conversation about race. \xc2\xa0We talk a lot about race. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no shortcut. \xc2\xa0And we don\xe2\x80\x99t need more talk. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0None of us should believe that a handful of gun safety measures will prevent every tragedy. \xc2\xa0It will not. \xc2\xa0People of goodwill will continue to debate the merits of various policies, as our democracy requires -- this is a big, raucous place, America is. \xc2\xa0And there are good people on both sides of these debates. \xc2\xa0Whatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete. But it would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Once the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change -- that\xe2\x80\x99s how we lose our way again. \xc2\xa0 It would be a refutation of the forgiveness expressed by those families if we merely slipped into old habits, whereby those who disagree with us are not merely wrong but bad; where we shout instead of listen; where we barricade ourselves behind preconceived notions or well-practiced cynicism. Reverend Pinckney once said, \xe2\x80\x9cAcross the South, we have a deep appreciation of history -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t always had a deep appreciation of each other\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0What is true in the South is true for America. \xc2\xa0Clem understood that justice grows out of recognition of ourselves in each other. \xc2\xa0That my liberty depends on you being free, too. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That history can\xe2\x80\x99t be a sword to justify injustice, or a shield against progress, but must be a manual for how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past -- how to break the cycle. \xc2\xa0A roadway toward a better world. \xc2\xa0He knew that the path of grace involves an open mind -- but, more importantly, an open heart. \xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt this week -- an open heart. \xc2\xa0That, more than any particular policy or analysis, is what\xe2\x80\x99s called upon right now, I think -- what a friend of mine, the writer Marilyn Robinson, calls \xe2\x80\x9cthat reservoir of goodness, beyond, and of another kind, that we are able to do each other in the ordinary cause of things.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0 That reservoir of goodness. \xc2\xa0If we can find that grace, anything is possible. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0If we can tap that grace, everything can change. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 Amazing grace. \xc2\xa0Amazing grace.\xc2\xa0 (Begins to sing) -- Amazing grace -- (applause) -- how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me; I once was lost, but now I\xe2\x80\x99m found; was blind but now I see. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 Clementa Pinckney found that grace. \xc2\xa0 Cynthia Hurd found that grace. \xc2\xa0 Susie Jackson found that grace. \xc2\xa0 Ethel Lance found that grace. \xc2\xa0 DePayne Middleton-Doctor found that grace. Tywanza Sanders found that grace. \xc2\xa0 Daniel L. Simmons, Sr. found that grace. \xc2\xa0 Sharonda Coleman-Singleton found that grace. \xc2\xa0 Myra Thompson found that grace. Through the example of their lives, they\xe2\x80\x99ve now passed it on to us. \xc2\xa0May we find ourselves worthy of that precious and extraordinary gift, as long as our lives endure. \xc2\xa0May grace now lead them home. \xc2\xa0May God continue to shed His grace on the United States of America. \xc2\xa0(Applause.)\xc2\xa0"
