b'THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 Four more years!\xc2\xa0 Four more years!\xc2\xa0 Four more years!\xc2\xa0 Four more years!\xc2\xa0 Four more years! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thank you. Michelle, I love you so much.\xc2\xa0 A few nights ago, everybody was reminded just what a lucky man I am.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Malia and Sasha, we are so proud of you.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, you do have to go to school in the morning.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) And, Joe Biden, thank you for being the very best Vice President I could have ever hoped for, and being a strong and loyal friend.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nMadam Chairwoman, delegates, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Now, the first time I addressed this convention in 2004, I was a younger man, a Senate candidate from Illinois, who spoke about hope -- not blind optimism, not wishful thinking, but hope in the face of difficulty; hope in the face of uncertainty; that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward, even when the odds are great, even when the road is long.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nEight years later, that hope has been tested by the cost of war, by one of the worst economic crises in history, and by political gridlock that\xe2\x80\x99s left us wondering whether it\xe2\x80\x99s still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nI know campaigns can seem small, even silly sometimes.\xc2\xa0 Trivial things become big distractions.\xc2\xa0 Serious issues become sound bites.\xc2\xa0 The truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re sick of hearing me approve this message, believe me, so am I.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut when all is said and done -- when you pick up that ballot to vote -- you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation.\xc2\xa0 Over the next few years, big decisions will be made in Washington on jobs, the economy, taxes and deficits, energy, education, war and peace -- decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and on our children\xe2\x80\x99s lives for decades to come.\xc2\xa0\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd on every issue, the choice you face won\xe2\x80\x99t just be between two candidates or two parties.\xc2\xa0 It will be a choice between two different paths for America, a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future. Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known\xc2\xa0 -- (applause) -- the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Patton\xe2\x80\x99s Army, the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone. They knew they were part of something larger -- a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression; a nation where the most innovative businesses turned out the world\xe2\x80\x99s best products. And everyone shared in that pride and success, from the corner office to the factory floor.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nMy grandparents were given the chance to go to college, buy their own home, and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of America\xe2\x80\x99s story -- the promise that hard work will pay off, that responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same rules from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd I ran for President because I saw that basic bargain slipping away.\xc2\xa0 I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas.\xc2\xa0 And by 2008, we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that didn\xe2\x80\x99the; folks racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition, put gas in the car or food on the table.\xc2\xa0 And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession, millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings -- a tragedy from which we\xe2\x80\x99re still fighting to recover.\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, our friends down in Tampa at the Republican Convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America.\xc2\xa0 But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to say about how they\xe2\x80\x99d make it right.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 They want your vote, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to know their plan.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions they\xe2\x80\x99ve had for the last 30 years -- Have a surplus?\xc2\xa0 Try a tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Deficit too high?\xc2\xa0 Try another.\xc2\xa0 Feel a cold coming on?\xc2\xa0 Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations and call us in the morning.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ve cut taxes for those who need it -- middle-class families, small businesses.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores or pay down our deficit.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy, or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) After all we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small businesswoman expand or the laid-off construction worker keep his home.\xc2\xa0 We have been there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve tried that and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going back.\xc2\xa0 We are moving forward, America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nNow, I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend the path I\xe2\x80\x99m offering is quick or easy. I never have.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear.\xc2\xa0 You elected me to tell you the truth.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And the truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades.\xc2\xa0 It will require common effort and shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, those of us who carry on his party\xe2\x80\x99s legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut know this, America -- our problems can be solved.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Our challenges can be met.\xc2\xa0 The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to choose that future.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country -- goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security, and the deficit -- real, achievable plans that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we can do in the next four years -- and that is why I\xe2\x80\x99m running for a second term as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nAUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 Four more years!\xc2\xa0 Four more years! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs.\xc2\xa0 After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting back to basics, and doing what America has always done best:\xc2\xa0 We are making things again.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve met workers in Detroit and Toledo -- (applause) -- who feared they\xe2\x80\x99d never build another American car.\xc2\xa0 And today, they can\xe2\x80\x99t build them fast enough, because we reinvented a dying auto industry that\xe2\x80\x99s back on the top of the world.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America -- not because our workers make less pay, but because we make better products.\xc2\xa0 Because we work harder and smarter than anyone else.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers -- goods that are stamped with three proud words:\xc2\xa0 Made in America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 U.S.A!\xc2\xa0 U.S.A.!\xc2\xa0 U.S.A.! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 And after a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years.\xc2\xa0 And now you have a choice:\xc2\xa0 We can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here, in the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports, and if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years.\xc2\xa0 You can make that happen.\xc2\xa0 You can choose that future. You can choose the path where we control more of our own energy.\xc2\xa0 After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We have doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries.\xc2\xa0 In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by 1 million barrels a day -- more than any administration in recent history.\xc2\xa0 And today, the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) So now you have a choice -- between a strategy that reverses this progress, or one that builds on it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll open more.\xc2\xa0 But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country\xe2\x80\x99s energy plan, or endanger our coastlines, or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re offering a better path.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re offering a better path, where we -- a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal; where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks; where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy; where we develop a hundred-year supply of natural gas that\xe2\x80\x99s right beneath our feet.\xc2\xa0 If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And, yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet -- because climate change is not a hoax.\xc2\xa0 More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke.\xc2\xa0 They are a threat to our children\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 And in this election, you can do something about it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete, no matter how old they are or how much money they have.\xc2\xa0 Education was the gateway to opportunity for me.\xc2\xa0 It was the gateway for Michelle.\xc2\xa0 It was the gateway for most of you.\xc2\xa0 And now more than ever, it is the gateway to a middle-class life.\xc2\xa0 For the first time in a generation, nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning.\xc2\xa0 Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading.\xc2\xa0 Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And now you have a choice -- we can gut education, or we can decide that in the United States of America, no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the money.\xc2\xa0 No company should have to look for workers overseas because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find any with the right skills here at home.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not our future.\xc2\xa0 That is not our future.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And government has a role in this.\xc2\xa0 But teachers must inspire; principals must lead; parents must instill a thirst for learning.\xc2\xa0 And, students, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do the work.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And together, I promise you, we can out-educate and out-compete any nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So help me.\xc2\xa0 Help me recruit 100,000 math and science teachers within 10 years and improve early-childhood education.\xc2\xa0 Help give 2 million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years.\xc2\xa0 We can meet that goal together.\xc2\xa0 You can choose that future for America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our future. In a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven.\xc2\xa0 Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We did.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11.\xc2\xa0 And we have.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve blunted the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum in Afghanistan, and in 2014, our longest war will be over.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 A new tower rises above the New York skyline; al Qaeda is on the path to defeat; and Osama bin Laden is dead.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 U.S.A.!\xc2\xa0 U.S.A.!\xc2\xa0 U.S.A.! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Tonight, we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0 We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected.\xc2\xa0 We will never forget you.\xc2\xa0 And so long as I\xe2\x80\x99m Commander-in-Chief, we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 When you take off the uniform, we will serve you as well as you\xe2\x80\x99ve served us -- because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job, or a roof over their heads, or the care that they need when they come home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Around the world, we\xe2\x80\x99ve strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers.\xc2\xa0 From Burma to Libya to South Sudan, we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings -- men and women; Christians and Muslims and Jews.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) But for all the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, challenges remain. Terrorist plots must be disrupted.\xc2\xa0 Europe\xe2\x80\x99s crisis must be contained.\xc2\xa0 Our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security must not waver, and neither must our pursuit of peace.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions.\xc2\xa0 The historic change sweeping across the Arab world must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists, but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate here today.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) So now we have a choice.\xc2\xa0 My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy -- (laughter and applause) -- but from all that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly.\r\nAfter all, you don\xe2\x80\x99t call Russia our number-one enemy -- not al Qaeda -- Russia -- unless you\xe2\x80\x99re still stuck in a Cold War mind warp.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can\xe2\x80\x99t visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 My opponent said that it was "tragic" to end the war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And he won\xe2\x80\x99t tell us how he\xe2\x80\x99ll end the war in Afghanistan. Well, I have -- and I will.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs don\xe2\x80\x99t even want, I will use the money we\xe2\x80\x99re no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work rebuilding roads and bridges and schools and runways.\xc2\xa0 Because after two wars that have cost us thousands of live and over a trillion dollars, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to do some nation-building right here at home.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Independent experts say that my plan would cut our deficit by $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 And last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut a billion [trillion] dollars in spending -- because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that it\xe2\x80\x99s leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I want to reform the tax code so that it\xe2\x80\x99s simple, fair, and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $250,000 -- the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was President; the same rate when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission.\xc2\xa0 No party has a monopoly on wisdom.\xc2\xa0 No democracy works without compromise.\xc2\xa0 I want to get this done, and we can get it done.\xc2\xa0 But when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy, well, what did Bill Clinton call it -- you do the arithmetic.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You do the math.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I refuse to go along with that and as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m President, I never will.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I refuse to ask middle-class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire\xe2\x80\x99s tax cut.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nI refuse to ask students to pay more for college, or kick children out of Head Start programs, or eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled -- all so those with the most can pay less.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going along with that.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And I will never -- I will never -- turn Medicare into a voucher.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll do it by reducing the cost of health care -- not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it, not by turning it over to Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) This is the choice we now face.\xc2\xa0 This is what the election comes down to.\xc2\xa0 Over and over, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way -- that since government can\xe2\x80\x99t do everything, it should do almost nothing.\xc2\xa0 If you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford health insurance, hope that you don\xe2\x80\x99t get sick.\xc2\xa0 If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the price of progress.\xc2\xa0 If you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to start a business or go to college, take my opponent\xe2\x80\x99s advice and borrow money from your parents.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.) You know what, that\xe2\x80\x99s not who we are.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what this country\xe2\x80\x99s about.\xc2\xa0 As Americans, we believe we are endowed by our Creator with certain, inalienable rights -- rights that no man or government can take away.\xc2\xa0 We insist on personal responsibility and we celebrate individual initiative.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not entitled to success -- we have to earn it.\xc2\xa0 We honor the strivers, the dreamers, the risk-takers, the entrepreneurs who have always been the driving force behind our free enterprise system, the greatest engine of growth and prosperity that the world\xe2\x80\x99s ever known. But we also believe in something called citizenship.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Citizenship:\xc2\xa0 a word at the very heart of our founding; a word at the very essence of our democracy; the idea that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another and to future generations.\xc2\xa0 We believe that when a CEO pays his autoworkers enough to buy the cars that they build, the whole company does better.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We believe that when a family can no longer be tricked into signing a mortgage they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford, that family is protected, but so is the value of other people\xe2\x80\x99s homes and so is the entire economy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We believe the little girl who\xe2\x80\x99s offered an escape from poverty by a great teacher or a grant for college could become the next Steve Jobs or the scientist who cures cancer or the President of the United States, and it is in our power to give her that chance.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We know that churches and charities can often make more of a difference than a poverty program alone.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want handouts for people who refuse to help themselves and we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want bailouts for banks that break the rules.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think that government can solve all of our problems, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that government is the source of all of our problems -- any more than are welfare recipients, or corporations, or unions, or immigrants, or gays, or any other group we\xe2\x80\x99re told to blame for our troubles.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Because, America, we understand that this democracy is ours. We, the people, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which asks only "what\xe2\x80\x99s in it for me," a freedom without commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism is unworthy of our founding ideals and those who died in their defense.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us; it\xe2\x80\x99s about what can be done by us, together, through the hard and frustrating, but necessary work of self-government.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) So, you see, the election four years ago wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about me.\xc2\xa0 It was about you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 My fellow citizens, you were the change.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the reason there\xe2\x80\x99s a little girl with a heart disorder in Phoenix who will get the surgery she needs because an insurance company can\xe2\x80\x99t limit her coverage.\xc2\xa0 You did that.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the reason a young man in Colorado who never thought he\xe2\x80\x99d be able to afford his dream of earning a medical degree is about to get that chance.\xc2\xa0 You made that possible.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) You\xe2\x80\x99re the reason a young immigrant who grew up here and went to school here and pledged allegiance to our flag will no longer be deported from the only country she\xe2\x80\x99s ever called home\r\n-- (applause) -- why selfless soldiers won\xe2\x80\x99t be kicked out of the military because of who they are or who they love; why thousands of families have finally been able to say to the loved ones who served us so bravely: \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome home."\xc2\xa0 "Welcome home.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You did that.\xc2\xa0 You did that.\xc2\xa0 You did that.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If you turn away now -- if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible, well, change will not happen.\xc2\xa0 If you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will fill the void -- the lobbyists and special interests; the people with the $10 million checks who are trying to buy this election and those who are making it harder for you to vote; Washington politicians who want to decide who you can marry, or control health care choices that women should be making for themselves.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Only you can make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 Only you have the power to move us forward.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention.\xc2\xa0 The times have changed, and so have I.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer just a candidate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m the President.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And that means I know what it means to send young Americans into battle, for I have held in my arms the mothers and fathers of those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t return.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve shared the pain of families who\xe2\x80\x99ve lost their homes, and the frustration of workers who\xe2\x80\x99ve lost their jobs.\xc2\xa0 If the critics are right that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made all my decisions based on polls, then I must not be very good at reading them.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And while I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved together, I\xe2\x80\x99m far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said, "I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go."\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) But as I stand here tonight, I have never been more hopeful about America.\xc2\xa0 Not because I think I have all the answers.\xc2\xa0 Not because I\xe2\x80\x99m na\xc3\xafve about the magnitude of our challenges.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful because of you.\xc2\xa0 The young woman I met at a science fair who won national recognition for her biology research while living with her family at a homeless shelter -- she gives me hope.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) The autoworker who won the lottery after his plant almost closed, but kept coming to work every day, and bought flags for his whole town, and one of the cars that he built to surprise his wife -- he gives me hope.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) The family business in Warroad, Minnesota, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t lay off a single one of their 4,000 employees when the recession hit, even when their competitors shut down dozens of plants, even when it meant the owner gave up some perks and some pay because they understood that their biggest asset was the community and the workers who had helped build that business -- they give me hope. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think about the young sailor I met at Walter Reed hospital, still recovering from a grenade attack that would cause him to have his leg amputated above the knee.\xc2\xa0 Six months ago, we would watch him walk into a White House dinner honoring those who served in Iraq, tall and 20 pounds heavier, dashing in his uniform, with a big grin on his face, sturdy on his new leg.\xc2\xa0 And I remember how a few months after that I would watch him on a bicycle, racing with his fellow wounded warriors on a sparkling spring day, inspiring other heroes who had just begun the hard path he had traveled -- he gives me hope.\xc2\xa0 He gives me hope.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what party these men and women belong to.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ll vote for me.\xc2\xa0 But I know that their spirit defines us.\xc2\xa0 They remind me, in the words of Scripture, that ours is a "future filled with hope."\xc2\xa0 And if you share that faith with me -- if you share that hope with me -- I ask you tonight for your vote.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If you reject the notion that this nation\xe2\x80\x99s promise is reserved for the few, your voice must be heard in this election.\xc2\xa0 If you reject the notion that our government is forever beholden to the highest bidder, you need to stand up in this election.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you believe that new plants and factories can dot our landscape, that new energy can power our future, that new schools can provide ladders of opportunity to this nation of dreamers; if you believe in a country where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules -- then I need you to vote this November.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 America, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t promise that now.\xc2\xa0 Yes, our path is harder, but it leads to a better place.\xc2\xa0 Yes, our road is longer, but we travel it together.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t turn back.\xc2\xa0 We leave no one behind.\xc2\xa0 We pull each other up.\xc2\xa0 We draw strength from our victories, and we learn from our mistakes, but we keep our eyes fixed on that distant horizon, knowing that Providence is with us, and that we are surely blessed to be citizens of the greatest nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 God bless you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And God bless these United States.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
