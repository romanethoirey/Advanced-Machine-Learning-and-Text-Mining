b'Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Please, have a seat.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 I want to begin by thanking Hillary Clinton, who has traveled so much these last six months that she is approaching a new landmark -- one million frequent flyer miles.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I count on Hillary every single day, and I believe that she will go down as one of the finest Secretaries of State in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history. The State Department is a fitting venue to mark a new chapter in American diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 For six months, we have witnessed an extraordinary change taking place in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 Square by square, town by town, country by country, the people have risen up to demand their basic human rights.\xc2\xa0 Two leaders have stepped aside.\xc2\xa0 More may follow.\xc2\xa0 And though these countries may be a great distance from our shores, we know that our own future is bound to this region by the forces of economics and security, by history and by faith. Today, I want to talk about this change -- the forces that are driving it and how we can respond in a way that advances our values and strengthens our security. Now, already, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done much to shift our foreign policy following a decade defined by two costly conflicts.\xc2\xa0 After years of war in Iraq, we\xe2\x80\x99ve removed 100,000 American troops and ended our combat mission there.\xc2\xa0 In Afghanistan, we\xe2\x80\x99ve broken the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum, and this July we will begin to bring our troops home and continue a transition to Afghan lead.\xc2\xa0 And after years of war against al Qaeda and its affiliates, we have dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader, Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was no martyr.\xc2\xa0 He was a mass murderer who offered a message of hate \xe2\x80\x93- an insistence that Muslims had to take up arms against the West, and that violence against men, women and children was the only path to change.\xc2\xa0 He rejected democracy and individual rights for Muslims in favor of violent extremism; his agenda focused on what he could destroy -\xe2\x80\x93 not what he could build. Bin Laden and his murderous vision won some adherents.\xc2\xa0 But even before his death, al Qaeda was losing its struggle for relevance, as the overwhelming majority of people saw that the slaughter of innocents did not answer their cries for a better life.\xc2\xa0 By the time we found bin Laden, al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s agenda had come to be seen by the vast majority of the region as a dead end, and the people of the Middle East and North Africa had taken their future into their own hands. That story of self-determination began six months ago in Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 On December 17th, a young vendor named Mohammed Bouazizi was devastated when a police officer confiscated his cart.\xc2\xa0 This was not unique.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same kind of humiliation that takes place every day in many parts of the world -\xe2\x80\x93 the relentless tyranny of governments that deny their citizens dignity.\xc2\xa0 Only this time, something different happened.\xc2\xa0 After local officials refused to hear his complaints, this young man, who had never been particularly active in politics, went to the headquarters of the provincial government, doused himself in fuel, and lit himself on fire. There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary citizens spark movements for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that has been building up for years.\xc2\xa0 In America, think of the defiance of those patriots in Boston who refused to pay taxes to a King, or the dignity of Rosa Parks as she sat courageously in her seat.\xc2\xa0 So it was in Tunisia, as that vendor\xe2\x80\x99s act of desperation tapped into the frustration felt throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 Hundreds of protesters took to the streets, then thousands.\xc2\xa0 And in the face of batons and sometimes bullets, they refused to go home \xe2\x80\x93- day after day, week after week -- until a dictator of more than two decades finally left power. The story of this revolution, and the ones that followed, should not have come as a surprise.\xc2\xa0 The nations of the Middle East and North Africa won their independence long ago, but in too many places their people did not.\xc2\xa0 In too many countries, power has been concentrated in the hands of a few.\xc2\xa0 In too many countries, a citizen like that young vendor had nowhere to turn\xc2\xa0 -\xe2\x80\x93 no honest judiciary to hear his case; no independent media to give him voice; no credible political party to represent his views; no free and fair election where he could choose his leader. And this lack of self-determination \xe2\x80\x93- the chance to make your life what you will \xe2\x80\x93- has applied to the region\xe2\x80\x99s economy as well.\xc2\xa0 Yes, some nations are blessed with wealth in oil and gas, and that has led to pockets of prosperity.\xc2\xa0 But in a global economy based on knowledge, based on innovation, no development strategy can be based solely upon what comes out of the ground. Nor can people reach their potential when you cannot start a business without paying a bribe. In the face of these challenges, too many leaders in the region tried to direct their people\xe2\x80\x99s grievances elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 The West was blamed as the source of all ills, a half-century after the end of colonialism.\xc2\xa0 Antagonism toward Israel became the only acceptable outlet for political expression.\xc2\xa0 Divisions of tribe, ethnicity and religious sect were manipulated as a means of holding on to power, or taking it away from somebody else. But the events of the past six months show us that strategies of repression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore.\xc2\xa0 Satellite television and the Internet provide a window into the wider world -\xe2\x80\x93 a world of astonishing progress in places like India and Indonesia and Brazil.\xc2\xa0 Cell phones and social networks allow young people to connect and organize like never before.\xc2\xa0 And so a new generation has emerged.\xc2\xa0 And their voices tell us that change cannot be denied. In Cairo, we heard the voice of the young mother who said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like I can finally breathe fresh air for the first time.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In Sanaa, we heard the students who chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cThe night must come to an end.\xe2\x80\x9d In Benghazi, we heard the engineer who said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur words are free now.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling you can\xe2\x80\x99t explain.\xe2\x80\x9d In Damascus, we heard the young man who said, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the first yelling, the first shout, you feel dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Those shouts of human dignity are being heard across the region.\xc2\xa0 And through the moral force of nonviolence, the people of the region have achieved more change in six months than terrorists have accomplished in decades. Of course, change of this magnitude does not come easily.\xc2\xa0 In our day and age -\xe2\x80\x93 a time of 24-hour news cycles and constant communication \xe2\x80\x93- people expect the transformation of the region to be resolved in a matter of weeks.\xc2\xa0 But it will be years before this story reaches its end.\xc2\xa0 Along the way, there will be good days and there will bad days.\xc2\xa0 In some places, change will be swift; in others, gradual.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen, calls for change may give way, in some cases, to fierce contests for power. The question before us is what role America will play as this story unfolds.\xc2\xa0 For decades, the United States has pursued a set of core interests in the region:\xc2\xa0 countering terrorism and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons; securing the free flow of commerce and safe-guarding the security of the region; standing up for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and pursuing Arab-Israeli peace. We will continue to do these things, with the firm belief that America\xe2\x80\x99s interests are not hostile to people\xe2\x80\x99s hopes; they\xe2\x80\x99re essential to them.\xc2\xa0 We believe that no one benefits from a nuclear arms race in the region, or al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s brutal attacks.\xc2\xa0 We believe people everywhere would see their economies crippled by a cut-off in energy supplies.\xc2\xa0 As we did in the Gulf War, we will not tolerate aggression across borders, and we will keep our commitments to friends and partners. Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, failure to speak to the broader aspirations of ordinary people will only feed the suspicion that has festered for years that the United States pursues our interests at their expense.\xc2\xa0 Given that this mistrust runs both ways \xe2\x80\x93- as Americans have been seared by hostage-taking and violent rhetoric and terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of our citizens -\xe2\x80\x93 a failure to change our approach threatens a deepening spiral of division between the United States and the Arab world. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, two years ago in Cairo, I began to broaden our engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect.\xc2\xa0 I believed then -\xe2\x80\x93 and I believe now -\xe2\x80\x93 that we have a stake not just in the stability of nations, but in the self-determination of individuals.\xc2\xa0 The status quo is not sustainable.\xc2\xa0 Societies held together by fear and repression may offer the illusion of stability for a time, but they are built upon fault lines that will eventually tear asunder. So we face a historic opportunity.\xc2\xa0 We have the chance to show that America values the dignity of the street vendor in Tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator.\xc2\xa0 There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise.\xc2\xa0 But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be. Of course, as we do, we must proceed with a sense of humility.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not America that put people into the streets of Tunis or Cairo -\xe2\x80\x93 it was the people themselves who launched these movements, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the people themselves that must ultimately determine their outcome.\xc2\xa0 Not every country will follow our particular form of representative democracy, and there will be times when our short-term interests don\xe2\x80\x99t align perfectly with our long-term vision for the region.\xc2\xa0 But we can, and we will, speak out for a set of core principles \xe2\x80\x93- principles that have guided our response to the events over the past six months: The United States opposes the use of violence and repression against the people of the region.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United States supports a set of universal rights.\xc2\xa0 And these rights include free speech, the freedom of peaceful assembly, the freedom of religion, equality for men and women under the rule of law, and the right to choose your own leaders\xc2\xa0 -\xe2\x80\x93 whether you live in Baghdad or Damascus, Sanaa or Tehran. And we support political and economic reform in the Middle East and North Africa that can meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region. Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest.\xc2\xa0 Today I want to make it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions, and supported by all of the diplomatic, economic and strategic tools at our disposal. Let me be specific.\xc2\xa0 First, it will be the policy of the United States to promote reform across the region, and to support transitions to democracy.\xc2\xa0 That effort begins in Egypt and Tunisia, where the stakes are high -\xe2\x80\x93 as Tunisia was at the vanguard of this democratic wave, and Egypt is both a longstanding partner and the Arab world\xe2\x80\x99s largest nation.\xc2\xa0 Both nations can set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership.\xc2\xa0 But our support must also extend to nations where transitions have yet to take place. Unfortunately, in too many countries, calls for change have thus far been answered by violence.\xc2\xa0 The most extreme example is Libya, where Muammar Qaddafi launched a war against his own people, promising to hunt them down like rats.\xc2\xa0 As I said when the United States joined an international coalition to intervene, we cannot prevent every injustice perpetrated by a regime against its people, and we have learned from our experience in Iraq just how costly and difficult it is to try to impose regime change by force -\xe2\x80\x93 no matter how well-intentioned it may be. But in Libya, we saw the prospect of imminent massacre, we had a mandate for action, and heard the Libyan people\xe2\x80\x99s call for help.\xc2\xa0 Had we not acted along with our NATO allies and regional coalition partners, thousands would have been killed.\xc2\xa0 The message would have been clear:\xc2\xa0 Keep power by killing as many people as it takes.\xc2\xa0 Now, time is working against Qaddafi. He does not have control over his country.\xc2\xa0 The opposition has organized a legitimate and credible Interim Council.\xc2\xa0 And when Qaddafi inevitably leaves or is forced from power, decades of provocation will come to an end, and the transition to a democratic Libya can proceed. While Libya has faced violence on the greatest scale, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only place where leaders have turned to repression to remain in power.\xc2\xa0 Most recently, the Syrian regime has chosen the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens.\xc2\xa0 The United States has condemned these actions, and working with the international community we have stepped up our sanctions on the Syrian regime \xe2\x80\x93- including sanctions announced yesterday on President Assad and those around him. The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0 President Assad now has a choice:\xc2\xa0 He can lead that transition, or get out of the way.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian government must stop shooting demonstrators and allow peaceful protests.\xc2\xa0 It must release political prisoners and stop unjust arrests.\xc2\xa0 It must allow human rights monitors to have access to cities like Dara\xe2\x80\x99a; and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise, President Assad and his regime will continue to be challenged from within and will continue to be isolated abroad. So far, Syria has followed its Iranian ally, seeking assistance from Tehran in the tactics of suppression.\xc2\xa0 And this speaks to the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime, which says it stand for the rights of protesters abroad, yet represses its own people at home.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s remember that the first peaceful protests in the region were in the streets of Tehran, where the government brutalized women and men, and threw innocent people into jail.\xc2\xa0 We still hear the chants echo from the rooftops of Tehran.\xc2\xa0 The image of a young woman dying in the streets is still seared in our memory.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to insist that the Iranian people deserve their universal rights, and a government that does not smother their aspirations. Now, our opposition to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s intolerance and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s repressive measures, as well as its illicit nuclear program and its support of terror, is well known.\xc2\xa0 But if America is to be credible, we must acknowledge that at times our friends in the region have not all reacted to the demands for consistent change -- with change that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the principles that I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined today.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true in Yemen, where President Saleh needs to follow through on his commitment to transfer power.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true today in Bahrain. Bahrain is a longstanding partner, and we are committed to its security.\xc2\xa0 We recognize that Iran has tried to take advantage of the turmoil there, and that the Bahraini government has a legitimate interest in the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, we have insisted both publicly and privately that mass arrests and brute force are at odds with the universal rights of Bahrain\xe2\x80\x99s citizens, and we will -- and such steps will not make legitimate calls for reform go away.\xc2\xa0 The only way forward is for the government and opposition to engage in a dialogue, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t have a real dialogue when parts of the peaceful opposition are in jail.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The government must create the conditions for dialogue, and the opposition must participate to forge a just future for all Bahrainis. Indeed, one of the broader lessons to be drawn from this period is that sectarian divides need not lead to conflict.\xc2\xa0 In Iraq, we see the promise of a multiethnic, multisectarian democracy.\xc2\xa0 The Iraqi people have rejected the perils of political violence in favor of a democratic process, even as they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken full responsibility for their own security.\xc2\xa0 Of course, like all new democracies, they will face setbacks.\xc2\xa0 But Iraq is poised to play a key role in the region if it continues its peaceful progress.\xc2\xa0 And as they do, we will be proud to stand with them as a steadfast partner. So in the months ahead, America must use all our influence to encourage reform in the region.\xc2\xa0 Even as we acknowledge that each country is different, we need to speak honestly about the principles that we believe in, with friend and foe alike.\xc2\xa0 Our message is simple:\xc2\xa0 If you take the risks that reform entails, you will have the full support of the United States.\xc2\xa0 We must also build on our efforts to broaden our engagement beyond elites, so that we reach the people who will shape the future -\xe2\x80\x93 particularly young people.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to make good on the commitments that I made in Cairo -\xe2\x80\x93 to build networks of entrepreneurs and expand exchanges in education, to foster cooperation in science and technology, and combat disease.\xc2\xa0 Across the region, we intend to provide assistance to civil society, including those that may not be officially sanctioned, and who speak uncomfortable truths.\xc2\xa0 And we will use the technology to connect with -\xe2\x80\x93 and listen to \xe2\x80\x93- the voices of the people. For the fact is, real reform does not come at the ballot box alone.\xc2\xa0 Through our efforts we must support those basic rights to speak your mind and access information.\xc2\xa0 We will support open access to the Internet, and the right of journalists to be heard -\xe2\x80\x93 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a big news organization or a lone blogger.\xc2\xa0 In the 21st century, information is power, the truth cannot be hidden, and the legitimacy of governments will ultimately depend on active and informed citizens. Such open discourse is important even if what is said does not square with our worldview.\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear, America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard, even if we disagree with them.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes we profoundly disagree with them. We look forward to working with all who embrace genuine and inclusive democracy.\xc2\xa0 What we will oppose is an attempt by any group to restrict the rights of others, and to hold power through coercion and not consent.\xc2\xa0 Because democracy depends not only on elections, but also strong and accountable institutions, and the respect for the rights of minorities. Such tolerance is particularly important when it comes to religion.\xc2\xa0 In Tahrir Square, we heard Egyptians from all walks of life chant, \xe2\x80\x9cMuslims, Christians, we are one.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 America will work to see that this spirit prevails -\xe2\x80\x93 that all faiths are respected, and that bridges are built among them.\xc2\xa0 In a region that was the birthplace of three world religions, intolerance can lead only to suffering and stagnation.\xc2\xa0 And for this season of change to succeed, Coptic Christians must have the right to worship freely in Cairo, just as Shia must never have their mosques destroyed in Bahrain. What is true for religious minorities is also true when it comes to the rights of women.\xc2\xa0 History shows that countries are more prosperous and more peaceful when women are empowered.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we will continue to insist that universal rights apply to women as well as men -\xe2\x80\x93 by focusing assistance on child and maternal health; by helping women to teach, or start a business; by standing up for the right of women to have their voices heard, and to run for office.\xc2\xa0 The region will never reach its full potential when more than half of its population is prevented from achieving their full potential.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Now, even as we promote political reform, even as we promote human rights in the region, our efforts can\xe2\x80\x99t stop there.\xc2\xa0 So the second way that we must support positive change in the region is through our efforts to advance economic development for nations that are transitioning to democracy.\xc2\xa0 After all, politics alone has not put protesters into the streets.\xc2\xa0 The tipping point for so many people is the more constant concern of putting food on the table and providing for a family.\xc2\xa0 Too many people in the region wake up with few expectations other than making it through the day, perhaps hoping that their luck will change.\xc2\xa0 Throughout the region, many young people have a solid education, but closed economies leave them unable to find a job.\xc2\xa0 Entrepreneurs are brimming with ideas, but corruption leaves them unable to profit from those ideas.\xc2\xa0 The greatest untapped resource in the Middle East and North Africa is the talent of its people.\xc2\xa0 In the recent protests, we see that talent on display, as people harness technology to move the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no coincidence that one of the leaders of Tahrir Square was an executive for Google.\xc2\xa0 That energy now needs to be channeled, in country after country, so that economic growth can solidify the accomplishments of the street.\xc2\xa0 For just as democratic revolutions can be triggered by a lack of individual opportunity, successful democratic transitions depend upon an expansion of growth and broad-based prosperity. So, drawing from what we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned around the world, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to focus on trade, not just aid; on investment, not just assistance.\xc2\xa0 The goal must be a model in which protectionism gives way to openness, the reigns of commerce pass from the few to the many, and the economy generates jobs for the young.\xc2\xa0 America\xe2\x80\x99s support for democracy will therefore be based on ensuring financial stability, promoting reform, and integrating competitive markets with each other and the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start with Tunisia and Egypt. First, we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to present a plan at next week\xe2\x80\x99s G8 summit for what needs to be done to stabilize and modernize the economies of Tunisia and Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Together, we must help them recover from the disruptions of their democratic upheaval, and support the governments that will be elected later this year.\xc2\xa0 And we are urging other countries to help Egypt and Tunisia meet its near-term financial needs. Second, we do not want a democratic Egypt to be saddled by the debts of its past.\xc2\xa0 So we will relieve a democratic Egypt of up to $1 billion in debt, and work with our Egyptian partners to invest these resources to foster growth and entrepreneurship.\xc2\xa0 We will help Egypt regain access to markets by guaranteeing $1 billion in borrowing that is needed to finance infrastructure and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And we will help newly democratic governments recover assets that were stolen. Third, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Congress to create Enterprise Funds to invest in Tunisia and Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And these will be modeled on funds that supported the transitions in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\xc2\xa0 OPIC will soon launch a $2 billion facility to support private investment across the region.\xc2\xa0 And we will work with the allies to refocus the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development so that it provides the same support for democratic transitions and economic modernization in the Middle East and North Africa as it has in Europe. Fourth, the United States will launch a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership Initiative in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 If you take out oil exports, this entire region of over 400 million people exports roughly the same amount as Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 So we will work with the EU to facilitate more trade within the region, build on existing agreements to promote integration with U.S. and European markets, and open the door for those countries who adopt high standards of reform and trade liberalization to construct a regional trade arrangement.\xc2\xa0 And just as EU membership served as an incentive for reform in Europe, so should the vision of a modern and prosperous economy create a powerful force for reform in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prosperity also requires tearing down walls that stand in the way of progress -\xe2\x80\x93 the corruption of elites who steal from their people; the red tape that stops an idea from becoming a business; the patronage that distributes wealth based on tribe or sect.\xc2\xa0 We will help governments meet international obligations, and invest efforts at anti-corruption -- by working with parliamentarians who are developing reforms, and activists who use technology to increase transparency and hold government accountable.\xc2\xa0 Politics and human rights; economic reform. Let me conclude by talking about another cornerstone of our approach to the region, and that relates to the pursuit of peace. For decades, the conflict between Israelis and Arabs has cast a shadow over the region.\xc2\xa0 For Israelis, it has meant living with the fear that their children could be blown up on a bus or by rockets fired at their homes, as well as the pain of knowing that other children in the region are taught to hate them.\xc2\xa0 For Palestinians, it has meant suffering the humiliation of occupation, and never living in a nation of their own.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, this conflict has come with a larger cost to the Middle East, as it impedes partnerships that could bring greater security and prosperity and empowerment to ordinary people. For over two years, my administration has worked with the parties and the international community to end this conflict, building on decades of work by previous administrations.\xc2\xa0 Yet expectations have gone unmet.\xc2\xa0 Israeli settlement activity continues.\xc2\xa0 Palestinians have walked away from talks.\xc2\xa0 The world looks at a conflict that has grinded on and on and on, and sees nothing but stalemate.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, there are those who argue that with all the change and uncertainty in the region, it is simply not possible to move forward now. I disagree.\xc2\xa0 At a time when the people of the Middle East and North Africa are casting off the burdens of the past, the drive for a lasting peace that ends the conflict and resolves all claims is more urgent than ever.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly true for the two parties involved. For the Palestinians, efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure.\xc2\xa0 Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September won\xe2\x80\x99t create an independent state. Palestinian leaders will not achieve peace or prosperity if Hamas insists on a path of terror and rejection.\xc2\xa0 And Palestinians will never realize their independence by denying the right of Israel to exist. As for Israel, our friendship is rooted deeply in a shared history and shared values.\xc2\xa0 Our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is unshakeable.\xc2\xa0 And we will stand against attempts to single it out for criticism in international forums.\xc2\xa0 But precisely because of our friendship, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we tell the truth:\xc2\xa0 The status quo is unsustainable, and Israel too must act boldly to advance a lasting peace. The fact is, a growing number of Palestinians live west of the Jordan River.\xc2\xa0 Technology will make it harder for Israel to defend itself.\xc2\xa0 A region undergoing profound change will lead to populism in which millions of people -\xe2\x80\x93 not just one or two leaders -- must believe peace is possible.\xc2\xa0 The international community is tired of an endless process that never produces an outcome. The dream of a Jewish and democratic state cannot be fulfilled with permanent occupation. Now, ultimately, it is up to the Israelis and Palestinians to take action.\xc2\xa0 No peace can be imposed upon them -- not by the United States; not by anybody else.\xc2\xa0 But endless delay won\xe2\x80\x99t make the problem go away.\xc2\xa0 What America and the international community can do is to state frankly what everyone knows -- a lasting peace will involve two states for two peoples:\xc2\xa0 Israel as a Jewish state and the homeland for the Jewish people, and the state of Palestine as the homeland for the Palestinian people, each state enjoying self-determination, mutual recognition, and peace. So while the core issues of the conflict must be negotiated, the basis of those negotiations is clear:\xc2\xa0 a viable Palestine, a secure Israel.\xc2\xa0 The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states, with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine.\xc2\xa0 We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.\xc2\xa0 The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves, and reach their full potential, in a sovereign and contiguous state.\xc2\xa0 As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to defend itself -\xe2\x80\x93 by itself -\xe2\x80\x93 against any threat.\xc2\xa0 Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism, to stop the infiltration of weapons, and to provide effective border security.\xc2\xa0 The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign, non-militarized state.\xc2\xa0 And the duration of this transition period must be agreed, and the effectiveness of security arrangements must be demonstrated. These principles provide a foundation for negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state; Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m aware that these steps alone will not resolve the conflict, because two wrenching and emotional issues will remain:\xc2\xa0 the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees.\xc2\xa0 But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair, and that respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 Now, let me say this:\xc2\xa0 Recognizing that negotiations need to begin with the issues of territory and security does not mean that it will be easy to come back to the table.\xc2\xa0 In particular, the recent announcement of an agreement between Fatah and Hamas raises profound and legitimate questions for Israel:\xc2\xa0 How can one negotiate with a party that has shown itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist?\xc2\xa0 And in the weeks and months to come, Palestinian leaders will have to provide a credible answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, the United States, our Quartet partners, and the Arab states will need to continue every effort to get beyond the current impasse. I recognize how hard this will be.\xc2\xa0 Suspicion and hostility has been passed on for generations, and at times it has hardened. But I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced that the majority of Israelis and Palestinians would rather look to the future than be trapped in the past.\xc2\xa0 We see that spirit in the Israeli father whose son was killed by Hamas, who helped start an organization that brought together Israelis and Palestinians who had lost loved ones.\xc2\xa0 That father said, \xe2\x80\x9cI gradually realized that the only hope for progress was to recognize the face of the conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We see it in the actions of a Palestinian who lost three daughters to Israeli shells in Gaza.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI have the right to feel angry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cSo many people were expecting me to hate.\xc2\xa0 My answer to them is I shall not hate.\xc2\xa0 Let us hope,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfor tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d That is the choice that must be made -\xe2\x80\x93 not simply in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but across the entire region -\xe2\x80\x93 a choice between hate and hope; between the shackles of the past and the promise of the future.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a choice that must be made by leaders and by the people, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a choice that will define the future of a region that served as the cradle of civilization and a crucible of strife. For all the challenges that lie ahead, we see many reasons to be hopeful.\xc2\xa0 In Egypt, we see it in the efforts of young people who led protests.\xc2\xa0 In Syria, we see it in the courage of those who brave bullets while chanting, \xe2\x80\x9cpeaceful, peaceful.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In Benghazi, a city threatened with destruction, we see it in the courthouse square where people gather to celebrate the freedoms that they had never known.\xc2\xa0 Across the region, those rights that we take for granted are being claimed with joy by those who are prying loose the grip of an iron fist. For the American people, the scenes of upheaval in the region may be unsettling, but the forces driving it are not unfamiliar.\xc2\xa0 Our own nation was founded through a rebellion against an empire.\xc2\xa0 Our people fought a painful Civil War that extended freedom and dignity to those who were enslaved.\xc2\xa0 And I would not be standing here today unless past generations turned to the moral force of nonviolence as a way to perfect our union \xe2\x80\x93- organizing, marching, protesting peacefully together to make real those words that declared our nation:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Those words must guide our response to the change that is transforming the Middle East and North Africa -\xe2\x80\x93 words which tell us that repression will fail, and that tyrants will fall, and that every man and woman is endowed with certain inalienable rights.\xc2\xa0 It will not be easy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no straight line to progress, and hardship always accompanies a season of hope.\xc2\xa0 But the United States of America was founded on the belief that people should govern themselves.\xc2\xa0 And now we cannot hesitate to stand squarely on the side of those who are reaching for their rights, knowing that their success will bring about a world that is more peaceful, more stable, and more just. Thank you very much, everybody.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0'
