b"Hello Rutgers! \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0R-U rah-rah! \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Thank you so much. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Everybody, please have a seat. \xc2\xa0Thank you, President Barchi, for that introduction. Let me congratulate my extraordinarily worthy fellow honorary Scarlet Knights, Dr. Burnell and Bill Moyers. \xc2\xa0 Matthew, good job. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0If you are interested, we can talk after this. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 One of the perks of my job is honorary degrees. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) But I have to tell you, it impresses nobody in my house. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Now Malia and Sasha just say, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, Dr. Dad, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you later. \xc2\xa0Can we have some money?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 To the Board of Governors; to Chairman Brown; to Lieutenant Governor Guadagno; Mayor Cahill; Mayor Wahler, members of Congress, Rutgers administrators, faculty, staff, friends, and family -- thank you for the honor of joining you for the 250th anniversary of this remarkable institution. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0But most of all, congratulations to the Class of 2016! \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\r\nI come here for a simple reason -- to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor ham question. \xc2\xa0(Laughter and applause.) \xc2\xa0I'm just kidding. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s not much I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The truth is, Rutgers, I came here because you asked. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Now, it's true that a lot of schools invite me to their commencement every year. \xc2\xa0But you are the first to launch a three-year campaign. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Emails, letters, tweets, YouTube videos. \xc2\xa0I even got three notes from the grandmother of your student body president. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And I have to say that really sealed the deal. \xc2\xa0That was smart, because I have a soft spot for grandmas. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I'm here, off Exit 9, on the banks of the Old Raritan -- (applause) -- at the site of one of the original nine colonial colleges. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Winners of the first-ever college football game. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0One of the newest members of the Big Ten. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Home of what I understand to be a Grease Truck for a Fat Sandwich. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers on your cheesesteaks -- (applause.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Michelle would approve. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But somehow, you have survived such death-defying acts. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0You also survived the daily jockeying for buses, from Livingston to Busch, to Cook, to Douglass, and back again. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0I suspect that a few of you are trying to survive this afternoon, after a late night at Olde Queens. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0You know who you are. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, however you got here, you made it. \xc2\xa0You made it. \xc2\xa0Today, you join a long line of Scarlet Knights whose energy and intellect have lifted this university to heights its founders could not have imagined. \xc2\xa0Two hundred and fifty years ago, when America was still just an idea, a charter from the Royal Governor -- Ben Franklin\xe2\x80\x99s son -- established Queen\xe2\x80\x99s College. \xc2\xa0A few years later, a handful of students gathered in a converted tavern for the first class. \xc2\xa0And from that first class in a pub, Rutgers has evolved into one of the finest research institutions in America. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 This is a place where you 3D-print prosthetic hands for children, and devise rooftop wind arrays that can power entire office buildings with clean, renewable energy. \xc2\xa0Every day, tens of thousands of students come here, to this intellectual melting pot, where ideas and cultures flow together among what might just be America\xe2\x80\x99s most diverse student body. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Here in New Brunswick, you can debate philosophy with a classmate from South Asia in one class, and then strike up a conversation on the EE Bus with a first-generation Latina student from Jersey City, before sitting down for your psych group project with a veteran who\xe2\x80\x99s going to school on the Post-9/11 GI Bill. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 America converges here. \xc2\xa0And in so many ways, the history of Rutgers mirrors the evolution of America -- the course by which we became bigger, stronger, and richer and more dynamic, and a more inclusive nation. \xc2\xa0 But America\xe2\x80\x99s progress has never been smooth or steady. \xc2\xa0Progress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t travel in a straight line. \xc2\xa0It zigs and zags in fits and starts. \xc2\xa0Progress in America has been hard and contentious, and sometimes bloody. \xc2\xa0It remains uneven and at times, for every two steps forward, it feels like we take one step back. \xc2\xa0 Now, for some of you, this may sound like your college career. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0It sounds like mine, anyway. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Which makes sense, because measured against the whole of human history, America remains a very young nation -- younger, even, than this university. But progress is bumpy. \xc2\xa0It always has been. \xc2\xa0But because of dreamers and innovators and strivers and activists, progress has been this nation\xe2\x80\x99s hallmark. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m fond of quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0It bends towards justice. \xc2\xa0I believe that. \xc2\xa0But I also believe that the arc of our nation, the arc of the world does not bend towards justice, or freedom, or equality, or prosperity on its own. \xc2\xa0It depends on us, on the choices we make, particularly at certain inflection points in history; particularly when big changes are happening and everything seems up for grabs. And, Class of 2016, you are graduating at such an inflection point. \xc2\xa0Since the start of this new millennium, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already witnessed horrific terrorist attacks, and war, and a Great Recession. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen economic and technological and cultural shifts that are profoundly altering how we work and how we communicate, how we live, how we form families. \xc2\xa0The pace of change is not subsiding; it is accelerating. \xc2\xa0And these changes offer not only great opportunity, but also great peril.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, your generation has everything it takes to lead this country toward a brighter future. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that you can make the right choices -- away from fear and division and paralysis, and toward cooperation and innovation and hope. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Now, partly, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident because, on average, you\xe2\x80\x99re smarter and better educated than my generation -- although we probably had better penmanship -- (laughter) -- and were certainly better spellers. \xc2\xa0We did not have spell-check back in my day. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not only better educated, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been more exposed to the world, more exposed to other cultures. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re more diverse. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re more environmentally conscious. \xc2\xa0You have a healthy skepticism for conventional wisdom. \xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the tools to lead us. \xc2\xa0And precisely because I have so much confidence in you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to spend the remainder of my time telling you exactly how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make the world better. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll figure it out. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll look at things with fresher eyes, unencumbered by the biases and blind spots and inertia and general crankiness of your parents and grandparents and old heads like me. \xc2\xa0But I do have a couple of suggestions that you may find useful as you go out there and conquer the world.\xc2\xa0 Point number one: \xc2\xa0When you hear someone longing for the \xe2\x80\x9cgood old days,\xe2\x80\x9d take it with a grain of salt. \xc2\xa0(Laughter and applause.) \xc2\xa0Take it with a grain of salt. \xc2\xa0We live in a great nation and we are rightly proud of our history. \xc2\xa0We are beneficiaries of the labor and the grit and the courage of generations who came before. \xc2\xa0But I guess it's part of human nature, especially in times of change and uncertainty, to want to look backwards and long for some imaginary past when everything worked, and the economy hummed, and all politicians were wise, and every kid was well-mannered, and America pretty much did whatever it wanted around the world. \xc2\xa0 Guess what. \xc2\xa0It ain\xe2\x80\x99t so. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cgood old days\xe2\x80\x9d weren\xe2\x80\x99t that great. \xc2\xa0Yes, there have been some stretches in our history where the economy grew much faster, or when government ran more smoothly. \xc2\xa0There were moments when, immediately after World War II, for example, or the end of the Cold War, when the world bent more easily to our will. \xc2\xa0But those are sporadic, those moments, those episodes. \xc2\xa0In fact, by almost every measure, America is better, and the world is better, than it was 50 years ago, or 30 years ago, or even eight years ago. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And by the way, I'm not -- set aside 150 years ago, pre-Civil War -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole bunch of stuff there we could talk about. \xc2\xa0Set aside life in the \xe2\x80\x9850s, when women and people of color were systematically excluded from big chunks of American life. \xc2\xa0Since I graduated, in 1983 -- which isn't that long ago -- (laughter) -- I'm just saying. \xc2\xa0Since I graduated, crime rates, teenage pregnancy, the share of Americans living in poverty -- they\xe2\x80\x99re all down. \xc2\xa0The share of Americans with college educations have gone way up. \xc2\xa0Our life expectancy has, as well. \xc2\xa0Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks in business and politics. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0More women are in the workforce. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re earning more money -- although it\xe2\x80\x99s long past time that we passed laws to make sure that women are getting the same pay for the same work as men. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, in the eight years since most of you started high school, we\xe2\x80\x99re also better off. \xc2\xa0You and your fellow graduates are entering the job market with better prospects than any time since 2007. \xc2\xa0Twenty million more Americans know the financial security of health insurance. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re less dependent on foreign oil. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve doubled the production of clean energy. \xc2\xa0We have cut the high school dropout rate. \xc2\xa0We've cut the deficit by two-thirds. \xc2\xa0Marriage equality is the law of the land. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And just as America is better, the world is better than when I graduated. \xc2\xa0Since I graduated, an Iron Curtain fell, apartheid ended. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s more democracy. \xc2\xa0We virtually eliminated certain diseases like polio. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve cut extreme poverty drastically. \xc2\xa0We've cut infant mortality by an enormous amount. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\r\nNow, I say all these things not to make you complacent. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bunch of big problems to solve. \xc2\xa0But I say it to point out that change has been a constant in our history. \xc2\xa0And the reason America is better is because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t look backwards we didn\xe2\x80\x99t fear the future. \xc2\xa0We seized the future and made it our own. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why it\xe2\x80\x99s always been young people like you that have brought about big change -- because you don't fear the future. \xc2\xa0 That leads me to my second point: \xc2\xa0The world is more interconnected than ever before, and it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming more connected every day. \xc2\xa0Building walls won\xe2\x80\x99t change that. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, as President, my first responsibility is always the security and prosperity of the United States. \xc2\xa0And as citizens, we all rightly put our country first. \xc2\xa0But if the past two decades have taught us anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0When overseas states start falling apart, they become breeding grounds for terrorists and ideologies of nihilism and despair that ultimately can reach our shores. \xc2\xa0When developing countries don\xe2\x80\x99t have functioning health systems, epidemics like Zika or Ebola can spread and threaten Americans, too. \xc2\xa0And a wall won't stop that. (Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 If we want to close loopholes that allow large corporations and wealthy individuals to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have the cooperation of other countries in a global financial system to help enforce financial laws. \xc2\xa0The point is, to help ourselves we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to help others -- (applause) -- not pull up the drawbridge and try to keep the world out.\xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And engagement does not just mean deploying our military. \xc2\xa0There are times where we must take military action to protect ourselves and our allies, and we are in awe of and we are grateful for the men and women who make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0But I worry if we think that the entire burden of our engagement with the world is up to the 1 percent who serve in our military, and the rest of us can just sit back and do nothing. \xc2\xa0They can't shoulder the entire burden. \xc2\xa0And engagement means using all the levers of our national power, and rallying the world to take on our shared challenges. \xc2\xa0 You look at something like trade, for example. \xc2\xa0We live in an age of global supply chains, and cargo ships that crisscross oceans, and online commerce that can render borders obsolete. \xc2\xa0And a lot of folks have legitimate concerns with the way globalization has progressed -- that's one of the changes that's been taking place -- jobs shipped overseas, trade deals that sometimes put workers and businesses at a disadvantage. \xc2\xa0But the answer isn\xe2\x80\x99t to stop trading with other countries. \xc2\xa0In this global economy, that\xe2\x80\x99s not even possible. \xc2\xa0The answer is to do trade the right way, by negotiating with other countries so that they raise their labor standards and their environmental standards; and we make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t impose unfair tariffs on American goods or steal American intellectual property. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s how we make sure that international rules are consistent with our values -- including human rights. \xc2\xa0And ultimately, that's how we help raise wages here in America. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s how we help our workers compete on a level playing field. \xc2\xa0 Building walls won't do that. (Applause.) \xc2\xa0It won't boost our economy, and it won\xe2\x80\x99t enhance our security either. \xc2\xa0Isolating or disparaging Muslims, suggesting that they should be treated differently when it comes to entering this country -- (applause) -- that is not just a betrayal of our values -- (applause) -- that's not just a betrayal of who we are, it would alienate the very communities at home and abroad who are our most important partners in the fight against violent extremism. \xc2\xa0 Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders, and blame our challenges on immigrants -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just run counter to our history as the world\xe2\x80\x99s melting pot; it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe. \xc2\xa0That's how we became America. \xc2\xa0Why would we want to stop it now? \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 AUDIENCE MEMBER: \xc2\xa0Four more years! THE PRESIDENT: \xc2\xa0Can't do it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Which brings me to my third point: \xc2\xa0Facts, evidence, reason, logic, an understanding of science -- these are good things. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0These are qualities you want in people making policy. \xc2\xa0These are qualities you want to continue to cultivate in yourselves as citizens. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That might seem obvious. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That's why we honor Bill Moyers or Dr. Burnell. We traditionally have valued those things. \xc2\xa0But if you were listening to today\xe2\x80\x99s political debate, you might wonder where this strain of anti-intellectualism came from. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0So, Class of 2016, let me be as clear as I can be. \xc2\xa0In politics and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0It's not cool to not know what you're talking about. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That's not keeping it real, or telling it like it is. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That's not challenging political correctness. \xc2\xa0That's just not knowing what you're talking about. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And yet, we've become confused about this. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look, our nation\xe2\x80\x99s Founders -- Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Jefferson -- they were born of the Enlightenment. \xc2\xa0They sought to escape superstition, and sectarianism, and tribalism, and no-nothingness. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0They believed in rational thought and experimentation, and the capacity of informed citizens to master our own fates. \xc2\xa0That is embedded in our constitutional design. \xc2\xa0That spirit informed our inventors and our explorers, the Edisons and the Wright Brothers, and the George Washington Carvers and the Grace Hoppers, and the Norman Borlaugs and the Steve Jobses. \xc2\xa0That's what built this country. And today, in every phone in one of your pockets -- (laughter) -- we have access to more information than at any time in human history, at a touch of a button. \xc2\xa0But, ironically, the flood of information hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made us more discerning of the truth. In some ways, it\xe2\x80\x99s just made us more confident in our ignorance. (Applause.) \xc2\xa0We assume whatever is on the web must be true. \xc2\xa0We search for sites that just reinforce our own predispositions. Opinions masquerade as facts. \xc2\xa0The wildest conspiracy theories are taken for gospel. \xc2\xa0 Now, understand, I am sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned during your years of college -- and if not, you will learn soon -- that there are a whole lot of folks who are book smart and have no common sense. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0That's the truth. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll meet them if you haven't already. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a fancy degree -- you got to talk to them to see whether they know what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Qualities like kindness and compassion, honesty, hard work -- they often matter more than technical skills or know-how. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 But when our leaders express a disdain for facts, when they\xe2\x80\x99re not held accountable for repeating falsehoods and just making stuff up, while actual experts are dismissed as elitists, then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a problem. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 You know, it's interesting that if we get sick, we actually want to make sure the doctors have gone to medical school, they know what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0If we get on a plane, we say we really want a pilot to be able to pilot the plane. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And yet, in our public lives, we certainly think, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't want somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s done it before.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Laughter and applause.) \xc2\xa0The rejection of facts, the rejection of reason and science -- that is the path to decline. \xc2\xa0It calls to mind the words of Carl Sagan, who graduated high school here in New Jersey -- (applause) -- he said: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depths of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The debate around climate change is a perfect example of this. \xc2\xa0Now, I recognize it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like the planet is warmer right now. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I understand. \xc2\xa0There was hail when I landed in Newark. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0(The wind starts blowing hard.) \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 But think about the climate change issue. \xc2\xa0Every day, there are officials in high office with responsibilities who mock the overwhelming consensus of the world\xe2\x80\x99s scientists that human activities and the release of carbon dioxide and methane and other substances are altering our climate in profound and dangerous ways. \xc2\xa0 A while back, you may have seen a United States senator trotted out a snowball during a floor speech in the middle of winter as \xe2\x80\x9cproof\xe2\x80\x9d that the world was not warming. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I mean, listen, climate change is not something subject to political spin. \xc2\xa0There is evidence. \xc2\xa0There are facts. \xc2\xa0We can see it happening right now. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0If we don\xe2\x80\x99t act, if we don't follow through on the progress we made in Paris, the progress we've been making here at home, your generation will feel the brunt of this catastrophe. \xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s up to you to insist upon and shape an informed debate. \xc2\xa0Imagine if Benjamin Franklin had seen that senator with the snowball, what he would think. \xc2\xa0Imagine if your 5th grade science teacher had seen that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99d get a D. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s a senator! \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) Look, I'm not suggesting that cold analysis and hard data are ultimately more important in life than passion, or faith, or love, or loyalty. \xc2\xa0I am suggesting that those highest expressions of our humanity can only flourish when our economy functions well, and proposed budgets add up, and our environment is protected. \xc2\xa0And to accomplish those things, to make collective decisions on behalf of a common good, we have to use our heads. \xc2\xa0We have to agree that facts and evidence matter. \xc2\xa0And we got to hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to know what the heck they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 All right. \xc2\xa0I only have two more points. \xc2\xa0I know it's getting cold and you guys have to graduate. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Point four: \xc2\xa0Have faith in democracy. \xc2\xa0Look, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not always pretty. \xc2\xa0 Really, I know. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I've been living it. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s how, bit by bit, generation by generation, we have made progress in this nation. \xc2\xa0That's how we banned child labor. \xc2\xa0That's how we cleaned up our air and our water. \xc2\xa0That's how we passed programs like Social Security and Medicare that lifted millions of seniors out of poverty. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 None of these changes happened overnight. \xc2\xa0They didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen because some charismatic leader got everybody suddenly to agree on everything. \xc2\xa0It didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen because some massive political revolution occurred. \xc2\xa0It actually happened over the course of years of advocacy, and organizing, and alliance-building, and deal-making, and the changing of public opinion. \xc2\xa0It happened because ordinary Americans who cared participated in the political process. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AUDIENCE MEMBER: \xc2\xa0Because of you! \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT: \xc2\xa0Well, that's nice. \xc2\xa0I mean, I helped, but -- (applause.) Look, if you want to change this country for the better, you better start participating. \xc2\xa0I'll give you an example on a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s minds right now -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s the growing inequality in our economy. \xc2\xa0Over much of the last century, we\xe2\x80\x99ve unleashed the strongest economic engine the world has ever seen, but over the past few decades, our economy has become more and more unequal. \xc2\xa0The top 10 percent of earners now take in half of all income in the U.S. \xc2\xa0In the past, it used to be a top CEO made 20 or 30 times the income of the average worker. \xc2\xa0Today, it\xe2\x80\x99s 300 times more. \xc2\xa0And wages aren\xe2\x80\x99t rising fast enough for millions of hardworking families. \xc2\xa0 Now, if we want to reverse those trends, there are a bunch of policies that would make a real difference. \xc2\xa0We can raise the minimum wage. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We can modernize our infrastructure. We can invest in early childhood education. \xc2\xa0We can make college more affordable. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0We can close tax loopholes on hedge fund managers and take that money and give tax breaks to help families with child care or retirement. \xc2\xa0And if we did these things, then we\xe2\x80\x99d help to restore the sense that hard work is rewarded and we could build an economy that truly works for everybody. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 Now, the reason some of these things have not happened, even though the majority of people approve of them, is really simple. It's not because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t proposing them. \xc2\xa0It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because the facts and the evidence showed they wouldn't work. \xc2\xa0It was because a huge chunk of Americans, especially young people, do not vote. \xc2\xa0\r\nIn 2014, voter turnout was the lowest since World War II. \xc2\xa0Fewer than one in five young people showed up to vote -- 2014. \xc2\xa0And the four who stayed home determined the course of this country just as much as the single one who voted. \xc2\xa0Because apathy has consequences. \xc2\xa0It determines who our Congress is. \xc2\xa0It determines what policies they prioritize. \xc2\xa0It even, for example, determines whether a really highly qualified Supreme Court nominee receives the courtesy of a hearing and a vote in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And, yes, big money in politics is a huge problem. \xc2\xa0We've got to reduce its influence. \xc2\xa0Yes, special interests and lobbyists have disproportionate access to the corridors of power. But, contrary to what we hear sometimes from both the left as well as the right, the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t as rigged as you think, and it certainly is not as hopeless as you think. \xc2\xa0Politicians care about being elected, and they especially care about being reelected. \xc2\xa0And if you vote and you elect a majority that represents your views, you will get what you want. \xc2\xa0And if you opt out, or stop paying attention, you won\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s that simple. (Applause.) \xc2\xa0It's not that complicated.\xc2\xa0 Now, one of the reasons that people don\xe2\x80\x99t vote is because they don\xe2\x80\x99t see the changes they were looking for right away. \xc2\xa0Well, guess what -- none of the great strides in our history happened right away. \xc2\xa0It took Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP decades to win Brown v. Board of Education; and then another decade after that to secure the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0And it took more time after that for it to start working. \xc2\xa0It took a proud daughter of New Jersey, Alice Paul, years of organizing marches and hunger strikes and protests, and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation, and writing letters and giving speeches, and working with congressional leaders before she and other suffragettes finally helped win women the right to vote. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 Each stage along the way required compromise. \xc2\xa0Sometimes you took half a loaf. \xc2\xa0You forged allies. \xc2\xa0Sometimes you lost on an issue, and then you came back to fight another day. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s how democracy works. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be committed to participating not just if you get immediate gratification, but you got to be a citizen full-time, all the time. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And if participation means voting, and it means compromise, and organizing and advocacy, it also means listening to those who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you. \xc2\xa0I know a couple years ago, folks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement. \xc2\xa0Now, I don't think it's a secret that I disagree with many of the foreign policies of Dr. Rice and the previous administration. \xc2\xa0But the notion that this community or the country would be better served by not hearing from a former Secretary of State, or shutting out what she had to say -- I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s misguided. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0I don't think that's how democracy works best, when we're not even willing to listen to each other. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0I believe that's misguided. \xc2\xa0 If you disagree with somebody, bring them in -- (applause)\xc2\xa0-- and ask them tough questions. \xc2\xa0Hold their feet to the fire. \xc2\xa0Make them defend their positions. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0If somebody has got a bad or offensive idea, prove it wrong. \xc2\xa0Engage it. \xc2\xa0Debate it. \xc2\xa0Stand up for what you believe in. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Don't be scared to take somebody on. \xc2\xa0Don't feel like you got to shut your ears off because you're too fragile and somebody might offend your sensibilities. \xc2\xa0Go at them if they\xe2\x80\x99re not making any sense. Use your logic and reason and words. \xc2\xa0And by doing so, you\xe2\x80\x99ll strengthen your own position, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hone your arguments. \xc2\xa0And maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll learn something and realize you don't know everything. \xc2\xa0And you may have a new understanding not only about what your opponents believe but maybe what you believe. \xc2\xa0Either way, you win. \xc2\xa0And more importantly, our democracy wins. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 So, anyway, all right. \xc2\xa0That's it, Class of 2016 -- (laughter) -- a few suggestions on how you can change the world. Except maybe I've got one last suggestion. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0Just one. \xc2\xa0And that is, gear yourself for the long haul. \xc2\xa0Whatever path you choose -- business, nonprofits, government, education, health care, the arts -- whatever it is, you're going to have some setbacks. \xc2\xa0You will deal occasionally with foolish people. \xc2\xa0You will be frustrated. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll have a boss that's not great. \xc2\xa0You won\xe2\x80\x99t always get everything you want -- at least not as fast as you want it. \xc2\xa0So you have to stick with it. \xc2\xa0You have to be persistent. \xc2\xa0And success, however small, however incomplete, success is still success. \xc2\xa0I always tell my daughters, you know, better is good. \xc2\xa0It may not be perfect, it may not be great, but it's good. \xc2\xa0That's how progress happens -- in societies and in our own lives. \xc2\xa0 So don\xe2\x80\x99t lose hope if sometimes you hit a roadblock. \xc2\xa0Don't lose hope in the face of naysayers. \xc2\xa0And certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t let resistance make you cynical. \xc2\xa0Cynicism is so easy, and cynics don\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish much. \xc2\xa0As a friend of mine who happens to be from New Jersey, a guy named Bruce Springsteen, once sang -- (applause) -- \xe2\x80\x9cthey spend their lives waiting for a moment that just don\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t let that be you. \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time waiting. \xc2\xa0 If you doubt you can make a difference, look at the impact some of your fellow graduates are already making. \xc2\xa0Look at what Matthew is doing. \xc2\xa0Look at somebody like Yasmin Ramadan, who began organizing anti-bullying assemblies when she was 10 years old to help kids handle bias and discrimination, and here at Rutgers, helped found the Muslim Public Relations Council to work with administrators and police to promote inclusion. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Look at somebody like Madison Little, who grew up dealing with some health issues, and started wondering what his care would have been like if he lived someplace else, and so, here at Rutgers, he took charge of a student nonprofit and worked with folks in Australia and Cambodia and Uganda to address the AIDS epidemic. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOur generation has so much energy to adapt and impact the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMy peers give me a lot of hope that we\xe2\x80\x99ll overcome the obstacles we face in society.\xe2\x80\x9d That's you! \xc2\xa0Is it any wonder that I am optimistic? \xc2\xa0Throughout our history, a new generation of Americans has reached up and bent the arc of history in the direction of more freedom, and more opportunity, and more justice. \xc2\xa0And, Class of 2016, it is your turn now -- (applause) -- to shape our nation\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, as well as your own. \xc2\xa0 So get to work. \xc2\xa0Make sure the next 250 years are better than the last. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0 Good luck. \xc2\xa0God bless you. \xc2\xa0God bless this country we love. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0(Applause.) \xc2\xa0"
