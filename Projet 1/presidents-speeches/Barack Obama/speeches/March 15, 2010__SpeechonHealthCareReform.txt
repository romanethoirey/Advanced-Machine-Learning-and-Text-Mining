b"THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Hello, Ohio!\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It is good to be here in the Buckeye State.\xc2\xa0 Congratulations on winning the Big Ten Championship.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I'm filling out my brackets now.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s even better to be out of Washington for a little while. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 O-H-I-O. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that kid Turner looks pretty good.\xc2\xa0 You guys are doing all right. It is wonderful to be here -- AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 I love you! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I love you back.\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Couple of people I just want to make sure I give special mention to.\xc2\xa0 First of all, you already saw him, Governor Ted Strickland in the house.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Ted is fighting every day to bring jobs and economic development to Ohio. So is your terrific United States Senator Sherrod Brown.\xc2\xa0 Love Sherrod Brown.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Your own congressman, who is tireless on behalf of working people, Dennis Kucinich.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 Vote yes! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Did you hear that, Dennis?\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, say that again. AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 Vote yes! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 A couple members of Congress are here:\xc2\xa0 U.S. Representative Betty Sutton.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 U.S. Representative Tim Ryan.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 U.S. Representative Charlie Wilson.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I want to thank Mayor Tom Perciak here in Strongsville.\xc2\xa0 Please, Mr. Mayor, you\xe2\x80\x99re on.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That's a good bunch of folks we got here in Ohio, working hard.\xc2\xa0 Which is why I'm glad to be back -- and let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to be out of Washington once in a while.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) I want to thank Connie -- I want to thank Connie, who introduced me.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank her and her family for being here on behalf of her sister, Natoma.\xc2\xa0 I don't know if everybody understood that Natoma is in the hospital right now, so Connie was filling in.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to share such a personal story, when your sister who you love so much is sick.\xc2\xa0 And so I appreciate Connie being willing to do so here today, and -- (applause) -- and I want everybody to understand that Connie and her sister are the reason that I\xe2\x80\x99m here today.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) See, Connie felt it was important that her sister\xe2\x80\x99s story be told.\xc2\xa0 But I want to just repeat what happened here.\xc2\xa0 Last month, I got a letter from Connie\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Natoma.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s self-employed, she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make ends meet, and for years she\xe2\x80\x99s done the responsible thing, just like most of you have.\xc2\xa0 She bought insurance -- she didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a big employer who provided her insurance, so she bought her health insurance through the individual market. And it was important for her to have insurance because 16 years ago, she was diagnosed with a treatable form of cancer.\xc2\xa0 And even though she had been cancer-free for more than a decade, the insurance companies kept on jacking up her rates, year after year.\xc2\xa0 So she increased her out-of-pocket expenses.\xc2\xa0 She raised her deductible.\xc2\xa0 She did everything she could to maintain her health insurance that would be there just in case she got sick, because she figured, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be -- she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position where, if she did get sick, somebody else would have to pick up the tab; that she\xe2\x80\x99d have to go to the emergency room; that the cost would be shifted onto folks through their higher insurance premiums or hospitals charging higher rates.\xc2\xa0 So she tried to do the right thing. And she upped her deductible last year to the minimum [sic], the highest possible deductible.\xc2\xa0 But despite that, Natoma\xe2\x80\x99s insurance company raised her premiums by more than 25 percent.\xc2\xa0 And over the past year, she paid more than $6,000 in monthly premiums. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 Boo! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 She paid more than $4,000 in out-of-pocket medical costs, for co-pays and medical care and prescriptions.\xc2\xa0 So all together, this woman paid $10,000 -- one year.\xc2\xa0 But because she never hit her deductible, her insurance company only spent $900 on her care.\xc2\xa0 So the insurance company is making -- getting $10,000; paying out $900.\xc2\xa0 Now, what comes in the mail at the end of last year? AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 A bill! AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 A rate hike! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a letter telling Natoma that her premiums would go up again by more than 40 percent. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 Boo! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s what happens.\xc2\xa0 She just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.\xc2\xa0 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the money.\xc2\xa0 She realized that if she paid those health insurance premiums that had been jacked up by 40 percent, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make her mortgage.\xc2\xa0 And despite her desire to keep her coverage, despite her fears that she would get sick and lose the home that her parents built -- she finally surrendered, she finally gave up her health insurance.\xc2\xa0 She stopped paying it -- she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make ends meet. So January was her last month of being insured.\xc2\xa0 Like so many responsible Americans -- folks who work hard every day, who try to do the right thing -- she was forced to hang her fortunes on chance.\xc2\xa0 To take a chance, that\xe2\x80\x99s all she could do.\xc2\xa0 She hoped against hope that she would stay healthy.\xc2\xa0 She feared terribly that she might not stay healthy. That was the letter that I read to the insurance companies, including the person responsible for raising her rates.\xc2\xa0 Now, I understand Natoma was pretty surprised when she found out that I had read it to these CEOs.\xc2\xa0 But I thought it was important for them to understand the human dimensions of this problem.\xc2\xa0 Her rates have been hiked more than 40 percent. And this was less than two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Natoma\xe2\x80\x99s worst fears were realized.\xc2\xa0 And just last week, she was working on a nearby farm, walking outside -- apparently, chasing after a cow -- (laughter) -- when she collapsed.\xc2\xa0 And she was rushed to the hospital.\xc2\xa0 She was very sick.\xc2\xa0 She needed two blood transfusions.\xc2\xa0 Doctors performed a battery of tests.\xc2\xa0 And on Saturday, Natoma was diagnosed with leukemia. Now, the reason Natoma is not here today is that she\xe2\x80\x99s lying on a hospital bed, suddenly faced with this emergency -- suddenly faced with the fight of her life.\xc2\xa0 She expects to face more than a month of aggressive chemotherapy.\xc2\xa0 She is racked with worry not only about her illness but about the costs of the tests and the treatment that she\xe2\x80\x99s surely going to need to beat it. So you want to know why I\xe2\x80\x99m here, Ohio?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here because of Natoma.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here because of the countless others who have been forced to face the most terrifying challenges in their lives with the added burden of medical bills they can\xe2\x80\x99t pay.\xc2\xa0 I don't think that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neither do you.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need health insurance right now.\xc2\xa0 Health insurance reform right now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 Obama!\xc2\xa0 Obama!\xc2\xa0 Obama!\xc2\xa0 Obama! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here because of my own mother\xe2\x80\x99s story.\xc2\xa0 She died of cancer, and in the last six months of her life, she was on the phone in her hospital room arguing with insurance companies instead of focusing on getting well and spending time with her family. I\xe2\x80\x99m here because of the millions who are denied coverage because of preexisting conditions or dropped from coverage when they get sick.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I\xe2\x80\x99m here because of the small businesses who are forced to choose between health care and hiring.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I\xe2\x80\x99m here because of the seniors unable to afford the prescriptions that they need.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I\xe2\x80\x99m here because of the folks seeing their premiums go up 20 and 30 and 40 and 50 and 60 percent in a year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Ohio, I am here because that is not the America I believe in and that\xe2\x80\x99s not the America that you believe in. AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your plan? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 So when you hear people say \xe2\x80\x9cstart over\xe2\x80\x9d -- AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 No!! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 -- I want you to think about Natoma.\xc2\xa0 When you hear people saying that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the \xe2\x80\x9cright time,\xe2\x80\x9d you think about what she\xe2\x80\x99s going through.\xc2\xa0 When you hear people talk about, well, what does this mean for the Democrats?\xc2\xa0 What does this mean for the Republicans?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the polls are doing.\xc2\xa0 When you hear people more worried about the politics of it than what\xe2\x80\x99s right and what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, I want you to think about Natoma and the millions of people all across this country who are looking for some help, and looking for some relief.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need health insurance reform right now.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Part of what makes this issue difficult is most of us do have health insurance, we still do.\xc2\xa0 And so -- and so we kind of feel like, well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of working for me; I\xe2\x80\x99m not worrying too much.\xc2\xa0 But what we have to understand is that what\xe2\x80\x99s happened to Natoma, there but for the grace of God go any one of us.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Anybody here, if you lost your job right now and after the COBRA ran out -- (Audience member faints.) THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 It looks like we\xe2\x80\x99ve got somebody who might\xe2\x80\x99ve fainted down there, so if we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a medic.\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who might\xe2\x80\x99ve fainted right down here, so if we can get a medic just back here.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re probably okay.\xc2\xa0 Just give her or him some space. AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 Hope you have insurance.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s just think about -- think about if you lost your job right now.\xc2\xa0 How many people here might have had a preexisting condition that would mean it\xe2\x80\x99d be very hard to get health insurance on the individual market?\xc2\xa0 Think about if you wanted to change jobs.\xc2\xa0 Think about if you wanted to start your own business but you suddenly had to give up your health insurance on your job.\xc2\xa0 Think about what happens if a child of yours, heaven forbid, got diagnosed with something that made it hard for them to insure.\r\nFor so many people, it may not be a problem right now but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a problem later, at any point.\xc2\xa0 And even if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got good health insurance, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to your premiums?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening to your co-payments?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening to your deductible?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re all going up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s money straight out of your pocket.\r\nSo the bottom line is this:\xc2\xa0 The status quo on health care is simply unsustainable.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t have -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t have a system that works better for the insurance companies than it does for the American people.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nAnd we know what will happen if we fail to act.\xc2\xa0 We know that our government will be plunged deeper into debt.\xc2\xa0 We know that millions more people will lose their coverage.\xc2\xa0 We know that rising costs will saddle millions more families with unaffordable expenses.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of small businesses are just going to drop their coverage altogether.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s already what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening.\r\nA study came out just yesterday -- this is a nonpartisan study -- it\xe2\x80\x99s found that without reform, premiums could more than double for individuals and families over the next decade.\xc2\xa0 Family policies could go to an average of $25,000 or more.\xc2\xa0 Can you afford that?\r\nAUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 No!\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You think your employer can afford that?\r\nAUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 No!\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Your employer can\xe2\x80\x99t sustain that.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen is, they\xe2\x80\x99re basically -- more and more of them are just going to say, you know what?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re on your own on this.\r\nWe have debated this issue now for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 Every proposal has been put on the table.\xc2\xa0 Every argument has been made.\xc2\xa0 I know a lot of people view this as a partisan issue, but, look, the fact is both parties have a lot of areas where we agree -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just politics are getting in the way of actually getting it done.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Somebody asked what\xe2\x80\x99s our plan.\xc2\xa0 Let me describe exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve ended up with a proposal that incorporates the best ideas from Democrats and Republicans, even though Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t give us any credit.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all right. You know, if you think about the debate around health care reform, there were some who wanted to scrap the system of private insurance and replace it with government-run care.\xc2\xa0 And, look, that works in a number of places, but I did not see that being practical to help right away for people who really need it. And on the other end of the spectrum, and this is what a lot of the Republicans are saying right now, there are those who simply believe that the answer is to unleash the insurance industry, to deregulate them further, provide them less oversight and fewer rules. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 Boo! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 This is called the fox-guarding-the-henhouse approach to health insurance reform.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So what it would do is it would give insurance companies more leeway to raise premiums, more leeway to deny care.\xc2\xa0 It would segment the market further.\xc2\xa0 It would be good if you were rich and healthy.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d save money.\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re an ordinary person, if you get older, if you get a little sicker, you\xe2\x80\x99d be paying more. Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we should give the government or insurance companies more control over health care in America.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to give you, the American people, more control over your own health insurance.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And that\xe2\x80\x99s what our proposal does.\xc2\xa0 Our proposal builds on the current system where most Americans get their health insurance from their employer.\xc2\xa0 So if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\xc2\xa0 If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\xc2\xa0 I don't want to interfere with people\xe2\x80\x99s relationships between them and their doctors. Essentially, here\xe2\x80\x99s what my proposal would change:\xc2\xa0 three things about the current health care system, but three important things. Number one, it would end the worst practices of the insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 All right?\xc2\xa0 This is like a patient\xe2\x80\x99s bill of rights on steroids.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Within the first year of signing health care reform, thousands of uninsured Americans with preexisting conditions will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time in their lives or the first time since they got sick.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This year, insurance companies will be banned forever from denying coverage to children with preexisting conditions.\xc2\xa0 So parents can have a little bit of security.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This year, under this legislation, insurance companies will be banned from dropping your coverage when you get sick.\xc2\xa0 Those practices would end.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) With this reform package, all new insurance plans would be required to offer free preventive care to their customers starting this year -- so free check-ups to catch preventable diseases on the front end.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a smart thing to do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Starting this year, if you buy a new plan, there won\xe2\x80\x99t be lifetime or restrictive annual limits on the amount of care you receive from your insurance companies, so you won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised by the fine print that says suddenly they\xe2\x80\x99ve stopped paying and you now suddenly are $50,000 or $100,000 or $200,000 out of pocket.\xc2\xa0 That won\xe2\x80\x99t -- that will not happen if this becomes law this year.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nI see -- I see some young people in the audience.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re an uninsured young adult, you will be able to stay on your parents\xe2\x80\x99 policy until you\xe2\x80\x99re 26 years old under this law.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\r\nSo number one -- number one is insurance reform.\xc2\xa0 The second thing that this plan would change about the current system is this:\xc2\xa0 For the first time, uninsured individuals, small businesses, they\xe2\x80\x99d have the same kind of choice of private health insurance that members of Congress get for themselves.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Understand if this reform becomes law, members of Congress, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting their insurance from the same place that the uninsured get theirs, because if it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for the American people, it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for the people who send us to Washington.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nSo basically what would happen is, we\xe2\x80\x99d set up a pool of people; millions of people across the country would all buy into these pools that give them more negotiating power.\xc2\xa0 If you work for a big company, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better insurance deal because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got more bargaining power as a whole.\xc2\xa0 We want you to have all the bargaining power that the federal employees have, that big companies have, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to buy in or a small business will be able to buy into this pool.\xc2\xa0 And that will lower rates, it\xe2\x80\x99s estimated, by up to 14 to 20 percent over what you\xe2\x80\x99re currently getting.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s money out of pocket.\r\nAnd what my proposal says is if you still can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the insurance in this new marketplace, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to offer you tax credits to do so.\xc2\xa0 And that will add up to the largest middle-class tax cut for health care in history.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nNow, when I was talking about this at that health care summit, some of you saw it -- I sat there for about seven hours; I know you guys watched the whole thing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But some of these folks said, well, we just -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a nice idea but we just can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to do that.\xc2\xa0 Look, I want everybody to understand -- the wealthiest among us can already buy the best insurance there is.\xc2\xa0 The least well among us, the poorest among us, they get their health care through Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s the middle class, it\xe2\x80\x99s working people that are getting squeezed, and that\xe2\x80\x99s who we have to help, and we can afford to do it.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Now, it is true that providing these tax credits to middle class families and small businesses, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost some money.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost about $100 billion per year.\xc2\xa0 But most of this comes from the nearly $2.5 trillion a year that Americans already spend on health care.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just right now, a lot of that money is being spent badly. So with this plan, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure the dollars we make -- the dollars that we spend on health care are going to make insurance more affordable and more secure.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to eliminate wasteful taxpayer subsidies that currently go to insurance company.\xc2\xa0 Insurance companies are making billions of dollars on subsidies from you, the taxpayer.\xc2\xa0 And if we take those subsidies away, we can use them to help folks like Natoma get health insurance so she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lose her house.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) And, yes, we will set a new fee on insurance companies because they stand to gain millions more customers who are buying insurance.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with them giving something back.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line:\xc2\xa0 Our proposal is paid for -- which, by the way, is more than can be said for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle when they passed that big prescription drug plan that cost about as much as my health care plan and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for any of it and it went straight to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And now they\xe2\x80\x99re up there on their high horse talking about, well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to expand the deficit.\xc2\xa0 This plan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expand the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Their plan expanded the deficit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we pay for what we do.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the responsible thing to do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nNow, so let me talk about the third thing, which is my proposal would bring down the cost of health care for families, for businesses, and for the federal government.\xc2\xa0 So Americans buying comparable coverage to what they have today -- I already said this -- would see premiums fall by 14 to 20 percent -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not my numbers, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says -- for Americans who get their insurance through the workplace.\xc2\xa0 How many people are getting insurance through their jobs right now?\xc2\xa0 Raise your hands.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Well, a lot of those folks, your employer it\xe2\x80\x99s estimated would see premiums fall by as much as 3,000 percent [sic], which means they could give you a raise.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nWe have incorporated most of the serious ideas from across the political spectrum about how to contain the rising costs of health care.\xc2\xa0 We go after waste and abuse in the system, especially in Medicare.\xc2\xa0 Our cost-cutting measures would reduce most people\xe2\x80\x99s premiums and bring down our deficit by up to a\xc2\xa0 trillion dollars over the next two decades.\xc2\xa0 Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t my numbers.\xc2\xa0 Those are the numbers determined by the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the referee.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they say, not what I say. Now, the opponents of reform, they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make a lot of different arguments to stop these changes.\xc2\xa0 You remember.\xc2\xa0 First, they said, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a government takeover of health care.\xc2\xa0 Well, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xc2\xa0 Well, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xc2\xa0 Then they said, well, what about death panels?\xc2\xa0 Well, that turned out -- that didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out to be true. You know, the most insidious argument they\xe2\x80\x99re making is the idea that somehow this would hurt Medicare.\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some seniors here with us today -- I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell; you guys look great.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have guessed.\xc2\xa0 But want to tell you directly:\xc2\xa0 This proposal adds almost a decade of solvency to Medicare.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This proposal would close the gap in prescription drug coverage, called the doughnut hole -- you know something about that -- that sticks seniors with thousands of dollars in drug costs.\xc2\xa0 This proposal will over time help to reduce the costs of Medicare that you pay every month.\xc2\xa0 This proposal would make preventive care free so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay out-of-pocket for tests to keep you healthy.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) So yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re going after the waste, the fraud, the abuse in Medicare.\xc2\xa0 We are eliminating some of the insurance subsidies that should be going to your care.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s because these dollars should be spent on care for seniors, not on the care and feeding of the insurance companies through sweetheart deals.\xc2\xa0 And every senior should know there is no cutting of your guaranteed Medicare benefits.\xc2\xa0 Period.\xc2\xa0 No \xe2\x80\x9cifs,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cands,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbuts.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This proposal makes Medicare stronger, it makes the coverage better, and it makes the finances more secure.\xc2\xa0 And anybody who says otherwise is either misinformed -- or they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to misinform you.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t let them hoodwink you.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re trying to hoodwink you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) So, look, Ohio, that\xe2\x80\x99s the proposal.\xc2\xa0 And I believe Congress owes the American people a final up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We need an up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to vote.\xc2\xa0 And now as we get closer to the vote, there is a lot of hand-wringing going on.\xc2\xa0 We hear a lot of people in Washington talking about politics, talking about what this means in November, talking about the poll numbers for Democrats and Republicans.\r\nAUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 We need courage!\r\nTHE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 We need courage.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Did you hear what somebody just said?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we need.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I came here today.\xc2\xa0 We need courage.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\r\nWe need courage.\xc2\xa0 You know, in the end, this debate is about far more than politics.\xc2\xa0 It comes down to what kind of country do we want to be.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the millions of lives that would be touched and, in some cases, saved, by making health insurance more secure and more affordable.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a woman who\xe2\x80\x99s lying in a hospital bed who just wants to be able to pay for the care she needs.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is, what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in this debate, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just our ability to solve this problem; it\xe2\x80\x99s about our ability to solve any problem. I was talking to Dennis Kucinich on the way over here about this.\xc2\xa0 I said, you know what?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been such a long time since we made government on the side of ordinary working folks -- (applause) -- where we did something for them that relieved some of their struggles; that made folks who work hard every day and are doing the right thing and who are looking out for the families and contributing to their communities, that just gave them a little bit of a better chance to live out their American Dream.\r\nThe American people want to know if it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible for Washington to look out for these interests, for their future.\xc2\xa0 So what they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is some courage.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for us to act.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for us to lead.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want us putting our finger out to the wind.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want us reading polls.\xc2\xa0 They want us to look and see what is the best thing for America, and then do what\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And as long as I hold this office, I intend to provide that leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I know these members of Congress are going to provide that leadership.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the politics, but I know what\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m calling on Congress to pass these reforms -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sign them into law.\xc2\xa0 I want some courage.\xc2\xa0 I want us to do the right thing, Ohio.\xc2\xa0 And with your help, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make it happen. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)"
