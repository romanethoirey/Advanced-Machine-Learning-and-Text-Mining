b'UDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 We love you, President Obama! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know I love you back.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It is a rare honor in this life to follow one of your heroes.\xc2\xa0 And John Lewis is one of my heroes. Now, I have to imagine that when a younger John Lewis woke up that morning 50 years ago and made his way to Brown Chapel, heroics were not on his mind.\xc2\xa0 A day like this was not on his mind.\xc2\xa0 Young folks with bedrolls and backpacks were milling about.\xc2\xa0 Veterans of the movement trained newcomers in the tactics of non-violence; the right way to protect yourself when attacked.\xc2\xa0 A doctor described what tear gas does to the body, while marchers scribbled down instructions for contacting their loved ones.\xc2\xa0 The air was thick with doubt, anticipation and fear.\xc2\xa0 And they comforted themselves with the final verse of the final hymn they sung: \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what may be the test, God will take care of you;\r\nLean, weary one, upon His breast, God will take care of you.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, his knapsack stocked with an apple, a toothbrush, and a book on government -- all you need for a night behind bars -- John Lewis led them out of the church on a mission to change America. President and Mrs. Bush, Governor Bentley, Mayor Evans, Sewell, Reverend Strong, members of Congress, elected officials, foot soldiers, friends, fellow Americans: As John noted, there are places and moments in America where this nation\xe2\x80\x99s destiny has been decided.\xc2\xa0 Many are sites of war -- Concord and Lexington, Appomattox, Gettysburg.\xc2\xa0 Others are sites that symbolize the daring of America\xe2\x80\x99s character -- Independence Hall and Seneca Falls, Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral. Selma is such a place.\xc2\xa0 In one afternoon 50 years ago, so much of our turbulent history -- the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war; the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow; the death of four little girls in Birmingham; and the dream of a Baptist preacher -- all that history met on this bridge.\xc2\xa0 It was not a clash of armies, but a clash of wills; a contest to determine the true meaning of America.\xc2\xa0 And because of men and women like John Lewis, Joseph Lowery, Hosea Williams, Amelia Boynton, Diane Nash, Ralph Abernathy, C.T. Vivian, Andrew Young, Fred Shuttlesworth, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and so many others, the idea of a just America and a fair America, an inclusive America, and a generous America -- that idea ultimately triumphed. As is true across the landscape of American history, we cannot examine this moment in isolation.\xc2\xa0 The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations; the leaders that day part of a long line of heroes. We gather here to celebrate them.\xc2\xa0 We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod; tear gas and the trampling hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching towards justice. They did as Scripture instructed:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cRejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And in the days to come, they went back again and again.\xc2\xa0 When the trumpet call sounded for more to join, the people came \xe2\x80\x93- black and white, young and old, Christian and Jew, waving the American flag and singing the same anthems full of faith and hope.\xc2\xa0 A white newsman, Bill Plante, who covered the marches then and who is with us here today, quipped that the growing number of white people lowered the quality of the singing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 To those who marched, though, those old gospel songs must have never sounded so sweet. In time, their chorus would well up and reach President Johnson.\xc2\xa0 And he would send them protection, and speak to the nation, echoing their call for America and the world to hear:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall overcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 What enormous faith these men and women had.\xc2\xa0 Faith in God, but also faith in America.\xc2\xa0 The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing.\xc2\xa0 But they gave courage to millions.\xc2\xa0 They held no elected office.\xc2\xa0 But they led a nation.\xc2\xa0 They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence, countless daily indignities \xe2\x80\x93- but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seek special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) What they did here will reverberate through the ages.\xc2\xa0 Not because the change they won was preordained; not because their victory was complete; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible, that love and hope can conquer hate. As we commemorate their achievement, we are well-served to remember that at the time of the marches, many in power condemned rather than praised them.\xc2\xa0 Back then, they were called Communists, or half-breeds, or outside agitators, sexual and moral degenerates, and worse \xe2\x80\x93- they were called everything but the name their parents gave them.\xc2\xa0 Their faith was questioned.\xc2\xa0 Their lives were threatened.\xc2\xa0 Their patriotism challenged. And yet, what could be more American than what happened in this place?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people \xe2\x80\x93- unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many, coming together to shape their country\xe2\x80\x99s course?\xc2\xa0 What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) That\xe2\x80\x99s why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance.\xc2\xa0 It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe the People\xe2\x80\xa6in order to form a more perfect union.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 These are not just words.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re a living thing, a call to action, a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny.\xc2\xa0 For founders like Franklin and Jefferson, for leaders like Lincoln and FDR, the success of our experiment in self-government rested on engaging all of our citizens in this work.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we celebrate here in Selma.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this movement was all about, one leg in our long journey toward freedom.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge, that\xe2\x80\x99s the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande; the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot, workers to organize against an unjust status quo; the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the idea held by generations of citizens who believed that America is a constant work in progress; who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths.\xc2\xa0 It requires the occasional disruption, the willingness to speak out for what is right, to shake up the status quo.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes us unique.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what cements our reputation as a beacon of opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Young people behind the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down that wall.\xc2\xa0 Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid.\xc2\xa0 Young people in Burma went to prison rather than submit to military rule.\xc2\xa0 They saw what John Lewis had done.\xc2\xa0 From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine, this generation of young people can draw strength from this place, where the powerless could change the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom.\xc2\xa0 They saw that idea made real right here in Selma, Alabama.\xc2\xa0 They saw that idea manifest itself here in America. Because of campaigns like this, a Voting Rights Act was passed.\xc2\xa0 Political and economic and social barriers came down.\xc2\xa0 And the change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African Americans who run boardrooms, who sit on the bench, who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities; from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of what they did, the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks, but for every American.\xc2\xa0 Women marched through those doors.\xc2\xa0 Latinos marched through those doors.\xc2\xa0 Asian Americans, gay Americans, Americans with disabilities -- they all came through those doors.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Their endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again, not by reasserting the past, but by transcending the past.\xc2\xa0 What a glorious thing, Dr. King might say.\xc2\xa0 And what a solemn debt we owe.\xc2\xa0 Which leads us to ask, just how might we repay that debt? First and foremost, we have to recognize that one day\xe2\x80\x99s commemoration, no matter how special, is not enough.\xc2\xa0 If Selma taught us anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s that our work is never done.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The American experiment in self-government gives work and purpose to each generation. Selma teaches us, as well, that action requires that we shed our cynicism.\xc2\xa0 For when it comes to the pursuit of justice, we can afford neither complacency nor despair. Just this week, I was asked whether I thought the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s Ferguson report shows that, with respect to race, little has changed in this country.\xc2\xa0 And I understood the question; the report\xe2\x80\x99s narrative was sadly familiar.\xc2\xa0 It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement.\xc2\xa0 But I rejected the notion that nothing\xe2\x80\x99s changed.\xc2\xa0 What happened in Ferguson may not be unique, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer endemic.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no longer sanctioned by law or by custom.\xc2\xa0 And before the Civil Rights Movement, it most surely was.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, that racial division is inherent to America.\xc2\xa0 If you think nothing\xe2\x80\x99s changed in the past 50 years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s.\xc2\xa0 Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing\xe2\x80\x99s changed.\xc2\xa0 Ask your gay friend if it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago.\xc2\xa0 To deny this progress, this hard-won progress -\xe2\x80\x93 our progress \xe2\x80\x93- would be to rob us of our own agency, our own capacity, our responsibility to do what we can to make America better.\xc2\xa0 Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest that Ferguson is an isolated incident; that racism is banished; that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the \xe2\x80\x9crace card\xe2\x80\x9d for their own purposes.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t need the Ferguson report to know that\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 We just need to open our eyes, and our ears, and our hearts to know that this nation\xe2\x80\x99s racial history still casts its long shadow upon us.\xc2\xa0 We know the march is not yet over.\xc2\xa0 We know the race is not yet won.\xc2\xa0 We know that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged, all of us, by the content of our character requires admitting as much, facing up to the truth.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe are capable of bearing a great burden,\xe2\x80\x9d James Baldwin once wrote, \xe2\x80\x9conce we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing America can\xe2\x80\x99t handle if we actually look squarely at the problem.\xc2\xa0 And this is work for all Americans, not just some.\xc2\xa0 Not just whites.\xc2\xa0 Not just blacks.\xc2\xa0 If we want to honor the courage of those who marched that day, then all of us are called to possess their moral imagination.\xc2\xa0 All of us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now.\xc2\xa0 All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends on our actions, on our attitudes, the things we teach our children.\xc2\xa0 And if we make such an effort, no matter how hard it may sometimes seem, laws can be passed, and consciences can be stirred, and consensus can be built.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 With such an effort, we can make sure our criminal justice system serves all and not just some.\xc2\xa0 Together, we can raise the level of mutual trust that policing is built on \xe2\x80\x93- the idea that police officers are members of the community they risk their lives to protect, and citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland, they just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago -\xe2\x80\x93 the protection of the law.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Together, we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded prisons, and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men, and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads, and good workers, and good neighbors.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t accept a free ride for anybody, nor do we believe in equality of outcomes.\xc2\xa0 But we do expect equal opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And if we really mean it, if we\xe2\x80\x99re not just giving lip service to it, but if we really mean it and are willing to sacrifice for it, then, yes, we can make sure every child gets an education suitable to this new century, one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need.\xc2\xa0 We can make sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a job, and a fair wage, and a real voice, and sturdier rungs on that ladder into the middle class. And with effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge \xe2\x80\x93- and that is the right to vote.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Right now, in 2015, 50 years after Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote.\xc2\xa0 As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, the Voting Rights Act stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. How can that be?\xc2\xa0 The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy, the result of Republican and Democratic efforts.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 President Reagan signed its renewal when he was in office.\xc2\xa0 President George W. Bush signed its renewal when he was in office.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it.\xc2\xa0 If we want to honor this day, let that hundred go back to Washington and gather four hundred more, and together, pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we honor those on this bridge.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Of course, our democracy is not the task of Congress alone, or the courts alone, or even the President alone.\xc2\xa0 If every new voter-suppression law was struck down today, we would still have, here in America, one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples.\xc2\xa0 Fifty years ago, registering to vote here in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, the number of bubbles on a bar of soap.\xc2\xa0 It meant risking your dignity, and sometimes, your life.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s our excuse today for not voting?\xc2\xa0 How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 How do we so fully give away our power, our voice, in shaping America\xe2\x80\x99s future?\xc2\xa0 Why are we pointing to somebody else when we could take the time just to go to the polling places?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We give away our power. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fellow marchers, so much has changed in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 We have endured war and we\xe2\x80\x99ve fashioned peace.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives.\xc2\xa0 We take for granted conveniences that our parents could have scarcely imagined.\xc2\xa0 But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship; that willingness of a 26-year-old deacon, or a Unitarian minister, or a young mother of five to decide they loved this country so much that they\xe2\x80\x99d risk everything to realize its promise. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it means to love America.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what it means to believe in America.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what it means when we say America is exceptional.\xc2\xa0 For we were born of change.\xc2\xa0 We broke the old aristocracies, declaring ourselves entitled not by bloodline, but endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.\xc2\xa0 We secure our rights and responsibilities through a system of self-government, of and by and for the people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we argue and fight with so much passion and conviction -- because we know our efforts matter.\xc2\xa0 We know America is what we make of it. Look at our history.\xc2\xa0 We are Lewis and Clark and Sacajawea, pioneers who braved the unfamiliar, followed by a stampede of farmers and miners, and entrepreneurs and hucksters.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our spirit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s who we are. We are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who could do as much as any man and then some.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re Susan B. Anthony, who shook the system until the law reflected that truth.\xc2\xa0 That is our character. We\xe2\x80\x99re the immigrants who stowed away on ships to reach these shores, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free \xe2\x80\x93- Holocaust survivors, Soviet defectors, the Lost Boys of Sudan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the hopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande because we want our kids to know a better life.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we came to be.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We\xe2\x80\x99re the slaves who built the White House and the economy of the South.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the ranch hands and cowboys who opened up the West, and countless laborers who laid rail, and raised skyscrapers, and organized for workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights. We\xe2\x80\x99re the fresh-faced GIs who fought to liberate a continent.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re the Tuskeegee Airmen, and the Navajo code-talkers, and the Japanese Americans who fought for this country even as their own liberty had been denied.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the firefighters who rushed into those buildings on 9/11, the volunteers who signed up to fight in Afghanistan and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the gay Americans whose blood ran in the streets of San Francisco and New York, just as blood ran down this bridge. (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We are storytellers, writers, poets, artists who abhor unfairness, and despise hypocrisy, and give voice to the voiceless, and tell truths that need to be told. We\xe2\x80\x99re the inventors of gospel and jazz and blues, bluegrass and country, and hip-hop and rock and roll, and our very own sound with all the sweet sorrow and reckless joy of freedom. We are Jackie Robinson, enduring scorn and spiked cleats and pitches coming straight to his head, and stealing home in the World Series anyway.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are the people Langston Hughes wrote of who \xe2\x80\x9cbuild our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We are the people Emerson wrote of, \xe2\x80\x9cwho for truth and honor\xe2\x80\x99s sake stand fast and suffer long;\xe2\x80\x9d who are \xe2\x80\x9cnever tired, so long as we can see far enough.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s what America is.\xc2\xa0 Not stock photos or airbrushed history, or feeble attempts to define some of us as more American than others.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We respect the past, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t pine for the past.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t fear the future; we grab for it.\xc2\xa0 America is not some fragile thing.\xc2\xa0 We are large, in the words of Whitman, containing multitudes.\xc2\xa0 We are boisterous and diverse and full of energy, perpetually young in spirit.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why someone like John Lewis at the ripe old age of 25 could lead a mighty march.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the young people here today and listening all across the country must take away from this day.\xc2\xa0 You are America.\xc2\xa0 Unconstrained by habit and convention.\xc2\xa0 Unencumbered by what is, because you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to seize what ought to be.\xc2\xa0 For everywhere in this country, there are first steps to be taken, there\xe2\x80\x99s new ground to cover, there are more bridges to be crossed.\xc2\xa0 And it is you, the young and fearless at heart, the most diverse and educated generation in our history, who the nation is waiting to follow. Because Selma shows us that America is not the project of any one person.\xc2\xa0 Because the single-most powerful word in our democracy is the word \xe2\x80\x9cWe.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe The People.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe Shall Overcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cYes We Can.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 That word is owned by no one.\xc2\xa0 It belongs to everyone.\xc2\xa0 Oh, what a glorious task we are given, to continually try to improve this great nation of ours. Fifty years from Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet finished, but we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer.\xc2\xa0 Two hundred and thirty-nine years after this nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding our union is not yet perfect, but we are getting closer.\xc2\xa0 Our job\xe2\x80\x99s easier because somebody already got us through that first mile.\xc2\xa0 Somebody already got us over that bridge.\xc2\xa0 When it feels the road is too hard, when the torch we\xe2\x80\x99ve been passed feels too heavy, we will remember these early travelers, and draw strength from their example, and hold firmly the words of the prophet Isaiah:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThose who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.\xc2\xa0 They will soar on [the] wings like eagles.\xc2\xa0 They will run and not grow weary.\xc2\xa0 They will walk and not be faint.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We honor those who walked so we could run.\xc2\xa0 We must run so our children soar.\xc2\xa0 And we will not grow weary.\xc2\xa0 For we believe in the power of an awesome God, and we believe in this country\xe2\x80\x99s sacred promise. May He bless those warriors of justice no longer with us, and bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everybody.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)'
