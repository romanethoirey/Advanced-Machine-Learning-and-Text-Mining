b"Hello, Connecticut.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you so much, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Let me begin by thanking Nicole, and Ian, for your brave words.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I want to thank them and all the Newtown families who have come here today, including your First Selectman, Pat Llodra.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Nobody could be more eloquent than Nicole and the other families on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we are so grateful for their courage and willingness to share their stories again and again, understanding that nothing is going to be more important in making sure the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them. I want to thank all the educators from Sandy Hook Elementary who have come here as well -- (applause) -- the survivors -- AUDIENCE MEMBERS:\xc2\xa0 We love you, Obama! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I love you back.\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 -- the survivors who still mourn and grieve, but are still going to work every day to love and raise those precious children in their care as fiercely as ever. I want to thank Governor Malloy for his leadership.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Very proud of him.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank the University of Hartford for hosting us this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Hawks.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank the people of Connecticut for everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done to honor the memories of the victims -- (applause) -- because you\xe2\x80\x99re part of their family as well.\xc2\xa0 One of your recent alumni, Rachel D\xe2\x80\x99Avino, was a behavioral therapist at Sandy Hook.\xc2\xa0 Two alumni of your performing arts school, Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez-Greene, lost their daughter, Ana -- an incredible, vibrant young girl who looked up to them, and learned from them, and inherited their talents by singing before she could talk.\xc2\xa0 So every family in this state was shaken by the tragedy of that morning.\xc2\xa0 Every family in this country was shaken.\xc2\xa0 We hugged our kids more tightly.\xc2\xa0 We asked what could we do, as a society, to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again.\xc2\xa0 And as a society, we decided that we have to change.\xc2\xa0 We must.\xc2\xa0 We must change.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I noticed that Nicole and others refer to that day as \xe2\x80\x9c12/14.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 For these families, it was a day that changed everything.\xc2\xa0 And I know many of you in Newtown wondered if the rest of us would live up to the promise we made in those dark days -- if we\xe2\x80\x99d change, too; or if once the television trucks left, once the candles flickered out, once the teddy bears were carefully gathered up, that the country would somehow move on to other things. Over the weekend, I heard Francine Wheeler, who lost her son Ben that day, say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some, but for her, it feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s been years since she saw Ben.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s determined not to let what happened that day just fade away.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe are here.\xc2\xa0 And we are going to be here.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown, everybody who was impacted.\xc2\xa0 And, Newtown, we want you to know that we\xe2\x80\x99re here with you.\xc2\xa0 We will not walk away from the promises we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We are as determined as ever to do what must be done.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not forgetting.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) We can't forget.\xc2\xa0 Your families still grieve in ways most of us can\xe2\x80\x99t comprehend.\xc2\xa0 But so many of you have used that grief to make a difference -- not just to honor your own children, but to protect the lives of all of our children.\xc2\xa0 So many of you have mobilized, and organized, and petitioned your elected officials \xe2\x80\x9cwith love and logic,\xe2\x80\x9d as Nicole put it -- as citizens determined to right something gone wrong. And last week, here in Connecticut, your elected leaders responded.\xc2\xa0 The Connecticut legislature, led by many of the legislators here today, passed new measures to protect more of our children and our communities from gun violence.\xc2\xa0 And Governor Malloy signed that legislation into law.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) So I want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 You, the families of Newtown, people across Connecticut, you helped make that happen.\xc2\xa0 Your voices, your determination made that happen.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the elected leaders did an extraordinary job moving it forward, but it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t hearing from people in their respective districts, people all across the state.\xc2\xa0 That's the power of your voice. And, by the way, Connecticut is not alone.\xc2\xa0 In the past few months, New York, Colorado, Maryland have all passed new, common-sense gun safety reforms as well.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) These are all states that share an awful familiarity with gun violence, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the horror of mass killings, or the street crime that\xe2\x80\x99s too common in too many neighborhoods.\xc2\xa0 All of these states also share a strong tradition of hunting, and sport shooting, and gun ownership.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a part of the fabric of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives for generations.\xc2\xa0 And every single one of those states -- including here in Connecticut -- decided that, yes, we can protect more of our citizens from gun violence while still protecting our Second Amendment rights.\xc2\xa0 Those two things don\xe2\x80\x99t contradict each other.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We can pass common-sense laws that protect our kids and protect our rights. So Connecticut has shown the way.\xc2\xa0 And now is the time for Congress to do the same.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Now is the time for Congress to do the same.\xc2\xa0 This week is the time for Congress to do the same.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Now, back in January, just a few months after the tragedy in Newtown, I announced a series of executive actions to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe.\xc2\xa0 And I put forward common-sense proposals -- much like those that passed here in Connecticut -- for Congress to consider.\xc2\xa0 And you'll remember in my State of the Union address, I urged Congress to give those proposals a vote.\xc2\xa0 And that moment is now.\xc2\xa0 As soon as this week, Congress will begin debating these common-sense proposals to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 Your senators, Dick Blumenthal and Chris Murphy -- they're here -- (applause) -- your Representatives, John Larson, Rosa DeLauro, Elizabeth Esty, Jim Hines, Joe Courtney, they are all pushing to pass this legislation.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 But much of Congress is going to only act if they hear from you, the American people.\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to do.\xc2\xa0 AUDIENCE MEMBER:\xc2\xa0 I love you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Here's what we've got to do.\xc2\xa0 We have to tell Congress it\xe2\x80\x99s time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that people who are dangerous to themselves and others cannot get their hands on a gun.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that happen.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We have to tell Congress it\xe2\x80\x99s time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folks will think twice before buying a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who won\xe2\x80\x99t pass a background check.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get that done.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We have to tell Congress it\xe2\x80\x99s time to restore the ban on military-style assault weapons, and a 10-round limit for magazines, to make it harder for a gunman to fire 154 bullets into his victims in less than five minutes.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s put that to a vote.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We have to tell Congress it\xe2\x80\x99s time to strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment they need before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do that for our kids and for our communities.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Now, I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others, but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people.\xc2\xa0 All of them are common sense.\xc2\xa0 All of them deserve a vote.\xc2\xa0 All of them deserve a vote.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Consider background checks.\xc2\xa0 Over the past 20 years, background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun.\xc2\xa0 A group of police officers in Colorado told me last week that, thanks to background checks, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to stop convicted murderers, folks under restraining orders for committing violent domestic abuse from buying a gun.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually arrested the person as they were coming to purchase the gun. So we know that background checks can work.\xc2\xa0 But the problem is loopholes in the current law let so many people avoid background checks altogether.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not safe.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re a law-abiding citizen and you go through a background check to buy a gun, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you expect other people to play by the same rules?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) If you\xe2\x80\x99re a law-abiding gun seller, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to know you\xe2\x80\x99re not selling your gun to someone who\xe2\x80\x99s likely to commit a crime?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we make it harder, not easier for somebody who is convicted of domestic abuse to get his hands on a gun?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) It turns out 90 percent of Americans think so.\xc2\xa0 Ninety percent of Americans support universal background checks.\xc2\xa0 Think about that.\xc2\xa0 How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And yet, 90 percent agree on this -- Republicans, Democrats, folks who own guns, folks who don\xe2\x80\x99t own guns; 80 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA households.\xc2\xa0 It is common sense. And yet, there is only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on, and that\xe2\x80\x99s politics in Washington.\xc2\xa0 You would think that with those numbers Congress would rush to make this happen.\xc2\xa0 That's what you would think.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If our democracy is working the way it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to, and 90 percent of the American people agree on something, in the wake of a tragedy you\xe2\x80\x99d think this would not be a heavy lift. And yet, some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms.\xc2\xa0 Think about that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not just saying they\xe2\x80\x99ll vote \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d on ideas that almost all Americans support.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying they\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re saying your opinion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not right. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 Booo -- THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 That is not right.\xc2\xa0 AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 We want a vote! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 We need a vote. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 We want a vote!\xc2\xa0 We want a vote!\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 We need a vote. AUDIENCE:\xc2\xa0 We want a vote! THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard some in the Washington press suggest that what happens to gun violence legislation in Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me.\xc2\xa0 Connecticut, this is not about me.\xc2\xa0 This is not about politics.\xc2\xa0 This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about them and all the families going forward, so we can prevent this from happening again.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s about.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this is about.\xc2\xa0 This is not about politics.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 This is not about politics. This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let\xe2\x80\x99s make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down.\xc2\xa0 When I said in my State of the Union address that these proposals deserve a vote -- that families of Newtown, and Aurora, and Tucson, and a former member of Congress, Gabby Giffords, that they all deserved a vote -\xe2\x80\x93 virtually every member of that chamber stood up and applauded.\xc2\xa0 And now they\xe2\x80\x99re going to start denying your families a vote when the cameras are off and when the lobbyists have worked what they do?\xc2\xa0 You deserve better than that.\xc2\xa0 You deserve a vote. Now, look, we knew from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy.\xc2\xa0 We knew that there would be powerful interests that are very good at confusing the subject, that are good at amplifying conflict and extremes, that are good at drowning out rational debate, good at ginning up irrational fears, all of which stands in the way of progress. But if our history teaches us anything, then it\xe2\x80\x99s up to us \xe2\x80\x93- the people -\xe2\x80\x93 to stand up to those who say we can\xe2\x80\x99t, or we won\xe2\x80\x99t; stand up for the change that we need.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people are looking for.\xc2\xa0 When I first ran for this office, I said that I did not believe the country was as divided as our politics would suggest, and I still believe that.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I know sometimes, when you watch cable news or talk radio, or you browse the Internet, you\xe2\x80\x99d think, man, everybody just hates each other, everybody is just at each other\xe2\x80\x99s throats.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not how most Americans think about these issues.\xc2\xa0 There are good people on both sides of every issue.\xc2\xa0 So if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move forward, we can\xe2\x80\x99t just talk past one another.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to listen to one another.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Governor Malloy and all these legislative leaders did.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why they were able to pass bipartisan legislation.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) I\xe2\x80\x99ve got stacks of letters from gun owners who want me to know that they care passionately about their right to bear arms, don\xe2\x80\x99t want them infringed upon, and I appreciate every one of those letters.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from them.\xc2\xa0 But a lot of those letters, what they\xe2\x80\x99ve also said is they\xe2\x80\x99re not just gun owners; they\xe2\x80\x99re also parents or police officers or veterans, and they agree that we can\xe2\x80\x99t stand by and keep letting these tragedies happen; that with our rights come some responsibilities and obligations to our communities and ourselves, and most of all to our children.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t just think about \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to think about \xe2\x80\x9cwe, the people.\xe2\x80\x9d I was in Colorado.\xc2\xa0 I told a story about Michelle.\xc2\xa0 She came back from a trip to rural Iowa; we were out there campaigning.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes it would be miles between farms, let alone towns.\xc2\xa0 And she said, you know, coming back, I can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection.\xc2\xa0 If somebody drove up into the driveway and, Barack, you weren\xe2\x80\x99t home, the sheriff lived miles away, I might want that security.\xc2\xa0 So she can understand what it might be like in terms of somebody wanting that kind of security.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, I also talked to a hunter last week who said, all my experiences with guns have been positive, but I also realize that for others, all their experiences with guns have been negative. And when he said that, I thought about the mom I met from suburban Chicago whose son was killed in a random shooting.\xc2\xa0 And this mom told me, I hate it when people tell me that my son was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\xc2\xa0 He was on his way to school.\xc2\xa0 He was exactly where he was supposed to be.\xc2\xa0 He was in the right place at the right time, and he still got shot.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 The kids at Sandy Hook were where they were supposed to be.\xc2\xa0 So were those moviegoers in Aurora.\xc2\xa0 So were those worshippers in Oak Creek.\xc2\xa0 So was Gabby Giffords.\xc2\xa0 She was at a supermarket, listening to the concerns of her constituents.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 They were exactly where they were supposed to be.\xc2\xa0 They were also exercising their rights -- to assemble peaceably; to worship freely and safely.\xc2\xa0 They were exercising the rights of life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\xc2\xa0 So surely, we can reconcile those two things.\xc2\xa0 Surely, America doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be divided between rural and urban, and Democrat and Republican when it comes to something like this.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re an American who wants to do something to prevent more families from knowing the immeasurable anguish that these families here have known, then we have to act.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time to get engaged.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time to get involved.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time to push back on fear, and frustration, and misinformation.\xc2\xa0 Now is the time for everybody to make their voices heard from every state house to the corridors of Congress. And I\xe2\x80\x99m asking everyone listening today, find out where your member of Congress stands on this.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks, then ask them, why not?\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to make it easier for law enforcement to do their job?\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to make it harder for a dangerous person to get his or her hands on a gun?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s more important to you:\xc2\xa0 our children, or an A-grade from the gun lobby?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Nicole talk about what her life has been like since Dylan was taken from her in December.\xc2\xa0 And one thing she said struck me.\xc2\xa0 She said, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery night, I beg for him to come to me in my dreams so that I can see him again.\xc2\xa0 And during the day, I just focus on what I need to do to honor him and make change.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Now, if Nicole can summon the courage to do that, how can the rest of us do any less?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 How can we do any less?\xc2\xa0 If there is even one thing we can do to protect our kids, don\xe2\x80\x99t we have an obligation to try?\xc2\xa0 If there is even one step we can take to keep somebody from murdering dozens of innocents in the span of minutes, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be taking that step?\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If there is just one thing we can do to keep one father from having to bury his child, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that worth fighting for? I've got to tell you, I've had tough days in the presidency -- I've said this before.\xc2\xa0 The day Newtown happened was the toughest day of my presidency.\xc2\xa0 But I've got to tell you, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t respond to this, that will be a tough day for me, too.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 Because we've got to expect more from ourselves, and we've got to expect more from Congress.\xc2\xa0 We've got to believe that every once in a while, we set politics aside and we just do what's right.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 We've got to believe that. And if you believe that, I'm asking you to stand up.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 If you believe in the right to bears arms, like I do, but think we should prevent an irresponsible few from inflicting harm -- stand up.\xc2\xa0 Stand up.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 If you believe that the families of Newtown and Aurora and Tucson and Virginia Tech and the thousands of Americans who have been gunned down in the last four months deserve a vote, we all have to stand up.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you want the people you send to Washington to have just an iota of the courage that the educators at Sandy Hook showed when danger arrived on their doorstep, then we\xe2\x80\x99re all going to have to stand up.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if we do, if we come together and raise our voices together and demand this change together, I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced cooperation and common sense will prevail.\xc2\xa0 We will find sensible, intelligent ways to make this country stronger and safer for our children.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do right by our kids.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do right by these families.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s get this done.\xc2\xa0 Connecticut, thank you.\xc2\xa0 God bless you.\xc2\xa0 God bless the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)"
