b'Good evening.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to talk to you about the end of our combat mission in Iraq, the ongoing security challenges we face, and the need to rebuild our nation here at home.\xc2\xa0 I know this historic moment comes at a time of great uncertainty for many Americans.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve now been through nearly a decade of war.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve endured a long and painful recession.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes in the midst of these storms, the future that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build for our nation -- a future of lasting peace and long-term prosperity -- may seem beyond our reach. But this milestone should serve as a reminder to all Americans that the future is ours to shape if we move forward with confidence and commitment.\xc2\xa0 It should also serve as a message to the world that the United States of America intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership in this young century. From this desk, seven and a half years ago, President Bush announced the beginning of military operations in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Much has changed since that night.\xc2\xa0 A war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency.\xc2\xa0 Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart.\xc2\xa0 Thousands of Americans gave their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded.\xc2\xa0 Our relations abroad were strained.\xc2\xa0 Our unity at home was tested. These are the rough waters encountered during the course of one of America\xe2\x80\x99s longest wars.\xc2\xa0 Yet there has been one constant amidst these shifting tides.\xc2\xa0 At every turn, America\xe2\x80\x99s men and women in uniform have served with courage and resolve.\xc2\xa0 As Commander-in-Chief, I am incredibly proud of their service.\xc2\xa0 And like all Americans, I\xe2\x80\x99m awed by their sacrifice, and by the sacrifices of their families. The Americans who have served in Iraq completed every mission they were given.\xc2\xa0 They defeated a regime that had terrorized its people.\xc2\xa0 Together with Iraqis and coalition partners who made huge sacrifices of their own, our troops fought block by block to help Iraq seize the chance for a better future.\xc2\xa0 They shifted tactics to protect the Iraqi people, trained Iraqi Security Forces, and took out terrorist leaders.\xc2\xa0 Because of our troops and civilians -- and because of the resilience of the Iraqi people -- Iraq has the opportunity to embrace a new destiny, even though many challenges remain. So tonight, I am announcing that the American combat mission in Iraq has ended.\xc2\xa0 Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was my pledge to the American people as a candidate for this office.\xc2\xa0 Last February, I announced a plan that would bring our combat brigades out of Iraq, while redoubling our efforts to strengthen Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Security Forces and support its government and people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve removed nearly 100,000 U.S. troops from Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve closed or transferred to the Iraqis hundreds of bases.\xc2\xa0 And we have moved millions of pieces of equipment out of Iraq. This completes a transition to Iraqi responsibility for their own security.\xc2\xa0 U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s cities last summer, and Iraqi forces have moved into the lead with considerable skill and commitment to their fellow citizens.\xc2\xa0 Even as Iraq continues to suffer terrorist attacks, security incidents have been near the lowest on record since the war began.\xc2\xa0 And Iraqi forces have taken the fight to al Qaeda, removing much of its leadership in Iraqi-led operations. This year also saw Iraq hold credible elections that drew a strong turnout.\xc2\xa0 A caretaker administration is in place as Iraqis form a government based on the results of that election.\xc2\xa0 Tonight, I encourage Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s leaders to move forward with a sense of urgency to form an inclusive government that is just, representative, and accountable to the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 And when that government is in place, there should be no doubt:\xc2\xa0 The Iraqi people will have a strong partner in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Our combat mission is ending, but our commitment to Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s future is not. Going forward, a transitional force of U.S. troops will remain in Iraq with a different mission:\xc2\xa0 advising and assisting Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s Security Forces, supporting Iraqi troops in targeted counterterrorism missions, and protecting our civilians.\xc2\xa0 Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year.\xc2\xa0 As our military draws down, our dedicated civilians -- diplomats, aid workers, and advisors -- are moving into the lead to support Iraq as it strengthens its government, resolves political disputes, resettles those displaced by war, and builds ties with the region and the world.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a message that Vice President Biden is delivering to the Iraqi people through his visit there today. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This new approach reflects our long-term partnership with Iraq -- one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.\xc2\xa0 Of course, violence will not end with our combat mission.\xc2\xa0 Extremists will continue to set off bombs, attack Iraqi civilians and try to spark sectarian strife.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, these terrorists will fail to achieve their goals.\xc2\xa0 Iraqis are a proud people.\xc2\xa0 They have rejected sectarian war, and they have no interest in endless destruction.\xc2\xa0 They understand that, in the end, only Iraqis can resolve their differences and police their streets.\xc2\xa0 Only Iraqis can build a democracy within their borders.\xc2\xa0 What America can do, and will do, is provide support for the Iraqi people as both a friend and a partner. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ending this war is not only in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s interest -- it\xe2\x80\x99s in our own.\xc2\xa0 The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people.\xc2\xa0 We have sent our young men and women to make enormous sacrifices in Iraq, and spent vast resources abroad at a time of tight budgets at home.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.\xc2\xa0 Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility.\xc2\xa0 Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to turn the page. As we do, I\xe2\x80\x99m mindful that the Iraq war has been a contentious issue at home.\xc2\xa0 Here, too, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to turn the page.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, I spoke to former President George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s well known that he and I disagreed about the war from its outset.\xc2\xa0 Yet no one can doubt President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s support for our troops, or his love of country and commitment to our security.\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, there were patriots who supported this war, and patriots who opposed it.\xc2\xa0 And all of us are united in appreciation for our servicemen and women, and our hopes for Iraqis\xe2\x80\x99 future. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The greatness of our democracy is grounded in our ability to move beyond our differences, and to learn from our experience as we confront the many challenges ahead.\xc2\xa0 And no challenge is more essential to our security than our fight against al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Americans across the political spectrum supported the use of force against those who attacked us on 9/11.\xc2\xa0 Now, as we approach our 10th year of combat in Afghanistan, there are those who are understandably asking tough questions about our mission there.\xc2\xa0 But we must never lose sight of what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.\xc2\xa0 As we speak, al Qaeda continues to plot against us, and its leadership remains anchored in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We will disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaeda, while preventing Afghanistan from again serving as a base for terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And because of our drawdown in Iraq, we are now able to apply the resources necessary to go on offense.\xc2\xa0 In fact, over the last 19 months, nearly a dozen al Qaeda leaders -- and hundreds of al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s extremist allies -- have been killed or captured around the world. Within Afghanistan, I\xe2\x80\x99ve ordered the deployment of additional troops who -- under the command of General David Petraeus -- are fighting to break the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\r\nAs with the surge in Iraq, these forces will be in place for a limited time to provide space for the Afghans to build their capacity and secure their own future.\xc2\xa0 But, as was the case in Iraq, we can\xe2\x80\x99t do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re training Afghan Security Forces and supporting a political resolution to Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s problems.\xc2\xa0 And next August, we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility.\xc2\xa0 The pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground, and our support for Afghanistan will endure.\xc2\xa0 But make no mistake:\xc2\xa0 This transition will begin -- because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan people\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Indeed, one of the lessons of our effort in Iraq is that American influence around the world is not a function of military force alone.\xc2\xa0 We must use all elements of our power -- including our diplomacy, our economic strength, and the power of America\xe2\x80\x99s example -- to secure our interests and stand by our allies.\xc2\xa0 And we must project a vision of the future that\xe2\x80\x99s based not just on our fears, but also on our hopes -- a vision that recognizes the real dangers that exist around the world,\xc2\xa0\r\nbut also the limitless possibilities of our time. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, old adversaries are at peace, and emerging democracies are potential partners.\xc2\xa0 New markets for our goods stretch from Asia to the Americas.\xc2\xa0 A new push for peace in the Middle East will begin here tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Billions of young people want to move beyond the shackles of poverty and conflict.\xc2\xa0 As the leader of the free world, America will do more than just defeat on the battlefield those who offer hatred and destruction -- we will also lead among those who are willing to work together to expand freedom and opportunity for all people. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, that effort must begin within our own borders.\xc2\xa0 Throughout our history, America has been willing to bear the burden of promoting liberty and human dignity overseas, understanding its links to our own liberty and security.\xc2\xa0 But we have also understood that our nation\xe2\x80\x99s strength and influence abroad must be firmly anchored in our prosperity at home.\xc2\xa0 And the bedrock of that prosperity must be a growing middle class. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, over the last decade, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not done what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to shore up the foundations of our own prosperity.\xc2\xa0 We spent a trillion dollars at war, often financed by borrowing from overseas.\xc2\xa0 This, in turn, has short-changed investments in our own people, and contributed to record deficits.\xc2\xa0 For too long, we have put off tough decisions on everything from our manufacturing base to our energy policy to education reform.\xc2\xa0 As a result, too many middle-class families find themselves working harder for less, while our nation\xe2\x80\x99s long-term competitiveness is put at risk. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so at this moment, as we wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy, and grit, and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad.\xc2\xa0 They have met every test that they faced.\xc2\xa0 Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s our turn.\xc2\xa0 Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s our responsibility to honor them by coming together, all of us, and working to secure the dream that so many generations have fought for -- the dream that a better life awaits anyone who is willing to work for it and reach for it. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our most urgent task is to restore our economy, and put the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs back to work.\xc2\xa0 To strengthen our middle class, we must give all our children the education they deserve, and all our workers the skills that they need to compete in a global economy.\xc2\xa0 We must jumpstart industries that create jobs, and end our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 We must unleash the innovation that allows new products to roll off our assembly lines, and nurture the ideas that spring from our entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 This will be difficult.\xc2\xa0 But in the days to come, it must be our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as President. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Part of that responsibility is making sure that we honor our commitments to those who have served our country with such valor.\xc2\xa0 As long as I am President, we will maintain the finest fighting force that the world has ever known, and we will do whatever it takes to serve our veterans as well as they have served us.\xc2\xa0 This is a sacred trust.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made one of the largest increases in funding for veterans in decades.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re treating the signature wounds of today\xe2\x80\x99s wars -- post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury -- while providing the health care and benefits that all of our veterans have earned.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re funding a Post-9/11 GI Bill that helps our veterans and their families pursue the dream of a college education.\xc2\xa0 Just as the GI Bill helped those who fought World War II -- including my grandfather -- become the backbone of our middle class, so today\xe2\x80\x99s servicemen and women must have the chance to apply their gifts to expand the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Because part of ending a war responsibly is standing by those who have fought it. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two weeks ago, America\xe2\x80\x99s final combat brigade in Iraq -- the Army\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Stryker Brigade -- journeyed home in the pre-dawn darkness.\xc2\xa0 Thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles made the trip from Baghdad, the last of them passing into Kuwait in the early morning hours.\xc2\xa0 Over seven years before, American troops and coalition partners had fought their way across similar highways, but this time no shots were fired.\xc2\xa0 It was just a convoy of brave Americans, making their way home. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course, the soldiers left much behind.\xc2\xa0 Some were teenagers when the war began.\xc2\xa0 Many have served multiple tours of duty, far from families who bore a heroic burden of their own, enduring the absence of a husband\xe2\x80\x99s embrace or a mother\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\xc2\xa0 Most painfully, since the war began, 55 members of the Fourth Stryker Brigade made the ultimate sacrifice -- part of over 4,400 Americans who have given their lives in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 As one staff sergeant said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that to my brothers in arms who fought and died, this day would probably mean a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those Americans gave their lives for the values that have lived in the hearts of our people for over two centuries.\xc2\xa0 Along with nearly 1.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq, they fought in a faraway place for people they never knew.\xc2\xa0 They stared into the darkest of human creations -- war -- and helped the Iraqi people seek the light of peace. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In an age without surrender ceremonies, we must earn victory through the success of our partners and the strength of our own nation.\xc2\xa0 Every American who serves joins an unbroken line of heroes that stretches from Lexington to Gettysburg; from Iwo Jima to Inchon; from Khe Sanh to Kandahar -- Americans who have fought to see that the lives of our children are better than our own.\xc2\xa0 Our troops are the steel in our ship of state.\xc2\xa0 And though our nation may be travelling through rough waters, they give us confidence that our course is true, and that beyond the pre-dawn darkness, better days lie ahead. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 May God bless you.\xc2\xa0 And may God bless the United States of America, and all who serve her.'
