b'Your Majesties, Your Royal Highnesses, distinguished members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, citizens of America, and citizens of the world:\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility.\xc2\xa0 It is an award that speaks to our highest aspirations -- that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world, we are not mere prisoners of fate.\xc2\xa0 Our actions matter, and can bend history in the direction of justice.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd yet I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage.\xc2\xa0 Compared to some of the giants of history who\'ve received this prize -- Schweitzer and King; Marshall and Mandela -- my accomplishments are slight.\xc2\xa0 And then there are the men and women around the world who have been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice; those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering; the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics.\xc2\xa0 I cannot argue with those who find these men and women -- some known, some obscure to all but those they help -- to be far more deserving of this honor than I.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars.\xc2\xa0 One of these wars is winding down.\xc2\xa0 The other is a conflict that America did not seek; one in which we are joined by 42 other countries -- including Norway -- in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nStill, we are at war, and I\'m responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land.\xc2\xa0 Some will kill, and some will be killed.\xc2\xa0 And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict -- filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nNow these questions are not new.\xc2\xa0 War, in one form or another, appeared with the first man.\xc2\xa0 At the dawn of history, its morality was not questioned; it was simply a fact, like drought or disease -- the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd over time, as codes of law sought to control violence within groups, so did philosophers and clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war.\xc2\xa0 The concept of a "just war" emerged, suggesting that war is justified only when certain conditions were met:\xc2\xa0 if it is waged as a last resort or in self-defense; if the force used is proportional; and if, whenever possible, civilians are spared from violence.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOf course, we know that for most of history, this concept of "just war" was rarely observed.\xc2\xa0 The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible, as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God.\xc2\xa0 Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations -- total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred.\xc2\xa0 In the span of 30 years, such carnage would twice engulf this continent.\xc2\xa0 And while it\'s hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers, World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn the wake of such destruction, and with the advent of the nuclear age, it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another world war.\xc2\xa0 And so, a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the League of Nations -- an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this prize -- America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace:\xc2\xa0 a Marshall Plan and a United Nations, mechanisms to govern the waging of war, treaties to protect human rights, prevent genocide, restrict the most dangerous weapons.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn many ways, these efforts succeeded.\xc2\xa0 Yes, terrible wars have been fought, and atrocities committed.\xc2\xa0 But there has been no Third World War.\xc2\xa0 The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall.\xc2\xa0 Commerce has stitched much of the world together.\xc2\xa0 Billions have been lifted from poverty.\xc2\xa0 The ideals of liberty and self-determination, equality and the rule of law have haltingly advanced.\xc2\xa0 We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past, and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd yet, a decade into a new century, this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats.\xc2\xa0 The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers, but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 Terrorism has long been a tactic, but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nMoreover, wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations.\xc2\xa0 The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts; the growth of secessionist movements, insurgencies, and failed states -- all these things have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos.\xc2\xa0 In today\'s wars, many more civilians are killed than soldiers; the seeds of future conflict are sown, economies are wrecked, civil societies torn asunder, refugees amassed, children scarred.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war.\xc2\xa0 What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision, hard work, and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago.\xc2\xa0 And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWe must begin by acknowledging the hard truth:\xc2\xa0 We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 There will be times when nations -- acting individually or in concert -- will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago:\xc2\xa0 "Violence never brings permanent peace.\xc2\xa0 It solves no social problem:\xc2\xa0 it merely creates new and more complicated ones."\xc2\xa0 As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King\'s life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence.\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s nothing weak -- nothing passive -- nothing na\xc3\xafve -- in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot be guided by their examples alone.\xc2\xa0 I face the world as it is, and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people.\xc2\xa0 For make no mistake:\xc2\xa0 Evil does exist in the world.\xc2\xa0 A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler\'s armies.\xc2\xa0 Negotiations cannot convince al Qaeda\'s leaders to lay down their arms.\xc2\xa0 To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism -- it is a recognition of history; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI raise this point, I begin with this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today, no matter what the cause.\xc2\xa0 And at times, this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America, the world\'s sole military superpower.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions -- not just treaties and declarations -- that brought stability to a post-World War II world.\xc2\xa0 Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this:\xc2\xa0 The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms.\xc2\xa0 The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans.\xc2\xa0 We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will.\xc2\xa0 We have done so out of enlightened self-interest -- because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others\' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace.\xc2\xa0 And yet this truth must coexist with another -- that no matter how justified, war promises human tragedy.\xc2\xa0 The soldier\'s courage and sacrifice is full of glory, expressing devotion to country, to cause, to comrades in arms.\xc2\xa0 But war itself is never glorious, and we must never trumpet it as such.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly inreconcilable truths -- that war is sometimes necessary, and war at some level is an expression of human folly.\xc2\xa0 Concretely, we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago.\xc2\xa0 "Let us focus," he said, "on a more practical, more attainable peace, based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions."\xc2\xa0 A gradual evolution of human institutions.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWhat might this evolution look like?\xc2\xa0 What might these practical steps be?\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nTo begin with, I believe that all nations -- strong and weak alike -- must adhere to standards that govern the use of force.\xc2\xa0 I -- like any head of state -- reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation.\xc2\xa0 Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to standards, international standards, strengthens those who do, and isolates and weakens those who don\'t. The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks, and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan, because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self-defense.\xc2\xa0 Likewise, the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait -- a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFurthermore, America -- in fact, no nation -- can insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves.\xc2\xa0 For when we don\'t, our actions appear arbitrary and undercut the legitimacy of future interventions, no matter how justified.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd this becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self-defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor.\xc2\xa0 More and more, we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war.\xc2\xa0 Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAmerica\'s commitment to global security will never waver.\xc2\xa0 But in a world in which threats are more diffuse, and missions more complex, America cannot act alone.\xc2\xa0 America alone cannot secure the peace.\xc2\xa0 This is true in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 This is true in failed states like Somalia, where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering.\xc2\xa0 And sadly, it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThe leaders and soldiers of NATO countries, and other friends and allies, demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they\'ve shown in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But in many countries, there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public.\xc2\xa0 I understand why war is not popular, but I also know this:\xc2\xa0 The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it.\xc2\xa0 Peace requires responsibility.\xc2\xa0 Peace entails sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why NATO continues to be indispensable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we must strengthen U.N. and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few countries.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome; to Ottawa and Sydney; to Dhaka and Kigali -- we honor them not as makers of war, but of wagers -- but as wagers of peace.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet me make one final point about the use of force.\xc2\xa0 Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about how we fight it.\xc2\xa0 The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant -- the founder of the Red Cross, and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nWhere force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct.\xc2\xa0 And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war.\xc2\xa0 That is what makes us different from those whom we fight.\xc2\xa0 That is a source of our strength.\xc2\xa0 That is why I prohibited torture.\xc2\xa0 That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed.\xc2\xa0 And that is why I have reaffirmed America\'s commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions.\xc2\xa0 We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 And we honor -- we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it\'s easy, but when it is hard.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI have spoken at some length to the question that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war.\xc2\xa0 But let me now turn to our effort to avoid such tragic choices, and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFirst, in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws, I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior -- for if we want a lasting peace, then the words of the international community must mean something.\xc2\xa0 Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 Sanctions must exact a real price.\xc2\xa0 Intransigence must be met with increased pressure -- and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nOne urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to seek a world without them.\xc2\xa0 In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear:\xc2\xa0 All will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work towards disarmament.\xc2\xa0 I am committed to upholding this treaty.\xc2\xa0 It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia\'s nuclear stockpiles.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nBut it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system.\xc2\xa0 Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted.\xc2\xa0 Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia.\xc2\xa0 Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war. The same principle applies to those who violate international laws by brutalizing their own people.\xc2\xa0 When there is genocide in Darfur, systematic rape in Congo, repression in Burma -- there must be consequences.\xc2\xa0 Yes, there will be engagement; yes, there will be diplomacy -- but there must be consequences when those things fail.\xc2\xa0 And the closer we stand together, the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThis brings me to a second point -- the nature of the peace that we seek.\xc2\xa0 For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict.\xc2\xa0 Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War.\xc2\xa0 In the wake of devastation, they recognized that if human rights are not protected, peace is a hollow promise.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd yet too often, these words are ignored.\xc2\xa0 For some countries, the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are somehow Western principles, foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation\'s development.\xc2\xa0 And within America, there has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists -- a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nI reject these choices.\xc2\xa0 I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear.\xc2\xa0 Pent-up grievances fester, and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence.\xc2\xa0 We also know that the opposite is true.\xc2\xa0 Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace.\xc2\xa0 America has never fought a war against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens.\xc2\xa0 No matter how callously defined, neither America\'s interests -- nor the world\'s -- are served by the denial of human aspirations.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nSo even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries, America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal.\xc2\xa0 We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi; to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings; to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran.\xc2\xa0 It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation.\xc2\xa0 And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear that these movements -- these movements of hope and history -- they have us on their side.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet me also say this:\xc2\xa0 The promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone.\xc2\xa0 At times, it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation.\xc2\xa0 But I also know that sanctions without outreach -- condemnation without discussion -- can carry forward only a crippling status quo.\xc2\xa0 No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIn light of the Cultural Revolution\'s horrors, Nixon\'s meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable -- and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty and connected to open societies.\xc2\xa0 Pope John Paul\'s engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church, but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa.\xc2\xa0 Ronald Reagan\'s efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union, but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no simple formula here.\xc2\xa0 But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nThird, a just peace includes not only civil and political rights -- it must encompass economic security and opportunity.\xc2\xa0 For true peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nIt is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security; it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food, or clean water, or the medicine and shelter they need to survive.\xc2\xa0 It does not exist where children can\'t aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family.\xc2\xa0 The absence of hope can rot a society from within.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd that\'s why helping farmers feed their own people -- or nations educate their children and care for the sick -- is not mere charity.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also why the world must come together to confront climate change.\xc2\xa0 There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing, we will face more drought, more famine, more mass displacement -- all of which will fuel more conflict for decades.\xc2\xa0 For this reason, it is not merely scientists and environmental activists who call for swift and forceful action -- it\'s military leaders in my own country and others who understand our common security hangs in the balance.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAgreements among nations.\xc2\xa0 Strong institutions.\xc2\xa0 Support for human rights.\xc2\xa0 Investments in development.\xc2\xa0 All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about.\xc2\xa0 And yet, I do not believe that we will have the will, the determination, the staying power, to complete this work without something more -- and that\'s the continued expansion of our moral imagination; an insistence that there\'s something irreducible that we all share.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAs the world grows smaller, you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are; to understand that we\'re all basically seeking the same things; that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd yet somehow, given the dizzying pace of globalization, the cultural leveling of modernity, it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities -- their race, their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion.\xc2\xa0 In some places, this fear has led to conflict.\xc2\xa0 At times, it even feels like we\'re moving backwards.\xc2\xa0 We see it in the Middle East, as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden.\xc2\xa0 We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nAnd most dangerously, we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam, and who attacked my country from Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God; the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded.\xc2\xa0 But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war.\xc2\xa0 For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will, then there is no need for restraint -- no need to spare the pregnant mother, or the medic, or the Red Cross worker, or even a person of one\'s own faith.\xc2\xa0 Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace, but I believe it\'s incompatible with the very purpose of faith -- for the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature.\xc2\xa0 For we are fallible.\xc2\xa0 We make mistakes, and fall victim to the temptations of pride, and power, and sometimes evil.\xc2\xa0 Even those of us with the best of intentions will at times fail to right the wrongs before us. But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected.\xc2\xa0 We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place.\xc2\xa0 The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached -- their fundamental faith in human progress -- that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nFor if we lose that faith -- if we dismiss it as silly or na\xc3\xafve; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace -- then we lose what\'s best about humanity.\xc2\xa0 We lose our sense of possibility.\xc2\xa0 We lose our moral compass.\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLike generations have before us, we must reject that future.\xc2\xa0 As Dr. King said at this occasion so many years ago, "I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history.\xc2\xa0 I refuse to accept the idea that the \'isness\' of man\'s present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal \'oughtness\' that forever confronts him."\r\n\xc2\xa0\r\nLet us reach for the world that ought to be -- that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) Somewhere today, in the here and now, in the world as it is, a soldier sees he\'s outgunned, but stands firm to keep the peace.\xc2\xa0 Somewhere today, in this world, a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government, but has the courage to march on.\xc2\xa0 Somewhere today, a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child, scrapes together what few coins she has to send that child to school -- because she believes that a cruel world still has a place for that child\'s dreams. Let us live by their example.\xc2\xa0 We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice.\xc2\xa0 We can admit the intractability of depravation, and still strive for dignity.\xc2\xa0 Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace.\xc2\xa0 We can do that -- for that is the story of human progress; that\'s the hope of all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth. Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0'
