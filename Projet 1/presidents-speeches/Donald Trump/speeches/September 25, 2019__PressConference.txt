b'PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you. Well, thank you all for being here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a tremendous three days in New York, at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank the Secretary-General.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been really incredible what\xe2\x80\x99s been taking place.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s been a fantastic host to a lot of countries. The meetings I had on a bilat, or close, were pretty staggering.\xc2\xa0 I think we set a new record, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check that out.\xc2\xa0 The \xe2\x80\x94 we met very, very \xe2\x80\x94 for pretty extended periods of time, either two and two, one on one, or just about at that level with Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, United Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\xc2\xa0 Other than that, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t too busy over the last three days. And, unfortunately, the press doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even cover it.\xc2\xa0 You know, we have \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some fantastic deals, like with Japan.\xc2\xa0 For farmers, we have a tremendous trade deal with Japan.\xc2\xa0 And that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get covered because you waste your time on nonsense. The PMI manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 index has gone substantially up, which was an incredible \xe2\x80\x94 Larry Kudlow, wherever you may be \xe2\x80\x94 Larry, please stand up.\xc2\xa0 He just gave me these numbers.\xc2\xa0 And existing new home sales are through the roof.\xc2\xa0 Just came out.\xc2\xa0 Oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve gone down very substantially.\xc2\xa0 So, we have plenty of oil.\xc2\xa0 But those numbers were surprising to you, Larry.\xc2\xa0 And the extent of the increase.\xc2\xa0 Is that a correct statement?\xc2\xa0 So thank you, Larry Kudlow. We think we\xe2\x80\x99ll make this little announcement to you because \xe2\x80\x94 important.\xc2\xa0 You know the so-called whistleblower?\xc2\xa0 The one that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any first-class, or first-rate, or second-tier information, from what I understand.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to figure that out for yourself.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken with Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 many of them \xe2\x80\x94 and we were going to do this anyway, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve informed them \xe2\x80\x94 all of the House members \xe2\x80\x94 that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly second-hand information, which is sort of interesting. And other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting.\xc2\xa0 But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China.\xc2\xa0 Millions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 Millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was Vice President.\xc2\xa0 And I think they should have transparency for that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve informed the Leader about that. And additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President, who I met and is an outstanding person.\xc2\xa0 I just met a little while ago; some of you were there.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be outstanding.\xc2\xa0 He got elected on the basis of corruption.\xc2\xa0 He wants to end corruption in Ukraine, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s great. But they went there and they wanted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.\xc2\xa0 They threatened him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do things.\xc2\xa0 Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re accusing me of, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t threaten anybody.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the press was asking questions of the President of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I used the word \xe2\x80\x9cpressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think he used the word \xe2\x80\x9cpush,\xe2\x80\x9d but he meant pressure, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing.\xc2\xa0 No push, no pressure, no nothing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all a hoax, folks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all a big hoax. And the sad thing about this hoax is that we work so hard with all of these countries \xe2\x80\x94 and I mean really hard.\xc2\xa0 This has been \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up from early in the morning to late in the evening, and meeting with different countries all for the good of our country, and the press doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even cover all of this.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s disappearing \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us. So, we want transparency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve informed Kevin McCarthy about transparency.\xc2\xa0 And we said, \xe2\x80\x9cVote for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have close to 100 percent of the Republican votes, I hope. And it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Prosecutor General expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were \xe2\x80\x9ccritical.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the right thing, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any assistance.\xc2\xa0 Gee, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sound familiar?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sound familiar? And Chris Murphy \xe2\x80\x94 who I\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with on guns \xe2\x80\x94 you know, so nice.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s always, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, no, we want to work it out.\xc2\xa0 We want to work it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt.\xc2\xa0 So, Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that, if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do things right, they won\xe2\x80\x99t have Democrat support in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re going to look all of this up. One other thing \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going off of certain notes and elements of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing over the last three days, but this just came up a few minutes ago: The \xe2\x80\x9cAmazon-Washington Post\xe2\x80\x9d just put out a fake article that Acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire \xe2\x80\x94 who I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to know, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a tough cookie \xe2\x80\x94 and I was surprised; I was shocked to hear this \xe2\x80\x94 was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him talk openly, freely.\xc2\xa0 And I was shocked because I know Joe, and he\xe2\x80\x99s tough.\xc2\xa0 A tough guy. And I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit.\xc2\xa0 Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement \xe2\x80\x94 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to Joe yet \xe2\x80\x94 but he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAt no time have I considered resigning my position.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 In other words, the story in the Washington Post was a fake. \xe2\x80\x9cAt no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on August 16, 2019.\xc2\xa0 I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s from the Acting Director of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire. So we\xe2\x80\x99re having a great period of time.\xc2\xa0 Our country is the strongest it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been economically.\xc2\xa0 Our numbers are phenomenal.\xc2\xa0 Wilbur, thank you.\xc2\xa0 And Larry.\xc2\xa0 Everybody.\xc2\xa0 The numbers are phenomenal.\xc2\xa0 Our economy is the strongest in the world.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the largest economy in the world. Had my opponent won, we would be second right now because China was catching us so rapidly, we would\xe2\x80\x99ve been second by this time.\xc2\xa0 And unless somebody does a very poor job as President, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be first for a long way, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country, and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars, and millions of jobs, and their supply chain.\xc2\xa0 And they want to make a deal. This year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before: Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen, the most jobs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had \xe2\x80\x94 you know you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say it many times \xe2\x80\x94 African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\xc2\xa0 And the most and best employment numbers: 160 million \xe2\x80\x94 very close to that number \xe2\x80\x94 in jobs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve never been anywhere close. Wages are up, and inequality is down.\xc2\xa0 Something that people don\xe2\x80\x99t like writing about.\xc2\xa0 But wages are up.\xc2\xa0 I used to speak during the campaign, and I\xe2\x80\x99d talk about wages where people were making less money three years ago than they were making 21 years, 22 years ago, and they\xe2\x80\x99d have two jobs and three jobs.\xc2\xa0 When I say \xe2\x80\x9cthree years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m talking into the area sometime prior to the election.\xc2\xa0 And they were doing very badly.\xc2\xa0 And now, for the first time in many years, wages are up and employment is up, and unemployment is down.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful thing to watch. In a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations, America renewed our friendships.\xc2\xa0 We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity. I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at length, of the United Kingdom, continuing our discussions on a magnificent, new bilateral trade deal.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens with respect to Brexit, but I suspect we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a fantastic deal with the UK. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years.\xc2\xa0 Over the last 20 years, frankly.\xc2\xa0 It should be a much bigger deal. That\xe2\x80\x99s true with many countries.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have an opportunity to come.\xc2\xa0 And they all want to do business with the United States, especially now. Earlier today, I stood alongside Prime Minister Abe of Japan \xe2\x80\x94 a friend of mine, a great gentleman.\xc2\xa0 Had a great reelection.\xc2\xa0 And we signed a terrific new trade deal, which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers, and technology.\xc2\xa0 The technology companies are really big beneficiaries. We also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan, India.\xc2\xa0 And many other nations are achieving stronger ties of fair and reciprocal trade.\xc2\xa0 And with respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir.\xc2\xa0 And whatever help I can be, I said \xe2\x80\x94 I offered, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration or mediation, or whatever it has to be, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever I can.\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re at very serious odds right now, and hopefully that\xe2\x80\x99ll get better. You look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries \xe2\x80\x94 two good friends of mine \xe2\x80\x94 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cFellas, work it out.\xc2\xa0 Just work it out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Those are two nuclear countries.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work it out. This week, we also made incredible strides on national security with President Duda of Poland.\xc2\xa0 We signed a joint declaration advancing defense cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And, crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100 percent of the money \xe2\x80\x94 something I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard said before.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re going to put up 100 percent of the money, of hosting additional U.S. military personnel that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking from various other countries.\xc2\xa0 We won\xe2\x80\x99t have more over; we\xe2\x80\x99ll have \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ll be moving them around. Poland is building us phenomenal new facilities.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re spending everything, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to really do a job.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll be moving a few thousand soldiers, and Poland will be paying that for it. Together with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, I signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation.\xc2\xa0 This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been changed in many years.\xc2\xa0 Then, yesterday, I met with prospective members of the Middle East Strategic Alliance, which is a group that I know very well; I know all of them.\xc2\xa0 And through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do. But because we\xe2\x80\x99re now independent, energy-wise \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re energy independent \xe2\x80\x94 we have very few boats going over the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 We used to have them going through the Straits all the time.\xc2\xa0 And you probably noticed that, every once in a while, they go after somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone after ours yet. If they do, they\xe2\x80\x99ve get big problems.\xc2\xa0 But we have very few boats going over there.\xc2\xa0 They were saying the other day, they\xe2\x80\x99ve never attacked an American boat, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking for trouble.\xc2\xa0 But if they do, they know they have far bigger trouble.\xc2\xa0 But then they said, \xe2\x80\x9cBut, you know, we don\xe2\x80\x99t see very many American boats over here anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d This week also brought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 In recent days, we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\xc2\xa0 We were with El Salvador today.\xc2\xa0 A great young gentleman became the President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s strong and tough, and he\xe2\x80\x99s taking care of crime.\xc2\xa0 He was really something today.\xc2\xa0 I was very impressed with him.\xc2\xa0 And likewise with Honduras, who we met.\xc2\xa0 We signed a cooperation agreement with both, and also with Guatemala. We\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum-seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99ll make a tremendous difference at our southern border. And Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 I have to say, President Lopez Obrador has been outstanding \xe2\x80\x94 an outstanding partner.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s doing a great job in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 The cartels are way down, and the numbers \xe2\x80\x94 our Secretary is here now \xe2\x80\x94 the numbers are way down.\xc2\xa0 Way, way down.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that without the help of Congress, meaning the Democrats in Congress who won\xe2\x80\x99t give us a single vote to take care of loopholes. We have loopholes that are so horrible, and it would be so easy to fix.\xc2\xa0 And they know they should be fixed but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give Trump any credit because it\xe2\x80\x99s all about the election.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all they care about.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t care about our country; they care about the election. And the sad part is, with all of the tremendous work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done this weekend \xe2\x80\x94 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary Pompeo, who had some outstanding, outstanding meetings \xe2\x80\x94 with all of this tremendous work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done, the press doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even cover it.\xc2\xa0 And the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week.\xc2\xa0 It was perfect.\xc2\xa0 Because this way, it takes away from these tremendous achievements that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of doing, that we\xe2\x80\x99re involved in in New York City, at the United Nations. So that was all planned, like everything else.\xc2\xa0 It was all planned.\xc2\xa0 And the witch hunt continues, but they\xe2\x80\x99re getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke.\xc2\xa0 Impeachment?\xc2\xa0 For that?\xc2\xa0 When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation? I think you should ask.\xc2\xa0 We actually \xe2\x80\x94 you know, that was the second conversation.\xc2\xa0 I think you should ask for the first conversation also.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they haven\xe2\x80\x99t, although I heard there\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x94 there\xe2\x80\x99s a rumor out they want the first conversation.\xc2\xa0 It was beautiful.\xc2\xa0 It was just a perfect conversation. But I think you should do that.\xc2\xa0 I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence\xe2\x80\x99s conversation because he had a couple conversations also.\xc2\xa0 I can save you a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re all perfect.\xc2\xa0 Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations.\xc2\xa0 But the word is that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask for the first phone conversation.\xc2\xa0 You can have it anytime you need it.\xc2\xa0 And also Mike Pence\xe2\x80\x99s conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them.\xc2\xa0 They were perfect.\xc2\xa0 They were all perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country. They\xe2\x80\x99re dividing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re belittling.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re demeaning our country.\xc2\xa0 So many leaders came up to me today and they said, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, what you go through, no President has ever gone through.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s so bad for your country.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 People laugh at the stupidity of what they\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for.\xc2\xa0 And here we could do asylum.\xc2\xa0 We could do all of these different things so easily.\xc2\xa0 We could do asylum quickly.\xc2\xa0 We could do loopholes; get rid of them. Instead, we actually made deals with Mexico and with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it.\xc2\xa0 We get it done. The wall is being built, by the way.\xc2\xa0 It got little coverage.\xc2\xa0 I went to the border.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going up in New Mexico.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going up in Arizona.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going up in California, believe it or not.\xc2\xa0 They really wanted that wall in California, in San Diego.\xc2\xa0 As soon as it was completed, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want a wall.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 They were begging me for a wall.\xc2\xa0 I should take it out and move it to another location. We were with the Governor \xe2\x80\x94 spoke to him a lot \xe2\x80\x94 but the Governor of Texas, Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Attorney General of Texas, the senators of Texas \xe2\x80\x94 Cornyn, Ted Cruz.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re building an incredible wall.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to \xe2\x80\x94 number one, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to look great.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you\xe2\x80\x99re one hell of a mountain climber.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very tough.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they\xe2\x80\x99re the real deal. I went to the Secretary of Homeland security, and he got all his people together.\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me four walls \xe2\x80\x94 your optimum.\xc2\xa0 Every single thing included.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And they give me 20 percent less, 20 percent less, and 20 percent less \xe2\x80\x94 meaning, less cost.\xc2\xa0 They came back, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the wall, sir.\xc2\xa0 This would be the best.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We have the panels on top, which are anti-climb panels.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you noticed the steel on top.\xc2\xa0 We have a different design for a different area, but this anti-climb is very tough.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x94 we had people going out and real climbers telling us which is the toughest to climb.\xc2\xa0 But these are anti-climb panels.\xc2\xa0 Very tough to get across. And the wall is going up, many miles a week.\xc2\xa0 And we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which we\xe2\x80\x99ll pretty much do it because you have a lot of natural barriers; you have mountains, you have really rough rivers.\xc2\xa0 You have some really rough land that you can\xe2\x80\x99t cross very easily.\xc2\xa0 So they serve as their natural walls.\xc2\xa0 But we \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ll have, we think, over 400, but we could even have 500 miles. To combat the malice, corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships, today I issued proclamations suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families. And further, to promote American values, on Monday I was proud to be the first President in history to host a meeting at the United Nations \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m so surprised; first President for this.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that I\xe2\x80\x99m first.\xc2\xa0 I spoke to Franklin Graham about that.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. \xe2\x80\x94 at the United Nations, on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world. While some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight every day against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people like no administration has in many, many years.\xc2\xa0 You forgot the American people.\xc2\xa0 You totally forgot the American people. This week, every \xe2\x80\x94 every week, I really can say \xe2\x80\x94 of my presidency, we\xe2\x80\x99re standing up for American prosperity, American security, and the American way of life.\xc2\xa0 And together, with our friends and partners, we\xe2\x80\x99re building a more peaceful, prosperous, and promising future. We have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, and that includes in South America, where they\xe2\x80\x99ve been so helpful, where nobody thought this would be possible.\xc2\xa0 The relationship with Mexico is an example, or El Salvador, or Honduras, or Guatemala.\xc2\xa0 Nobody even knew about it.\xc2\xa0 Yet, we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars, and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in. We had tremendous \xe2\x80\x94 we had tremendous \xe2\x80\x94 it was terrible.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got that stopped, and the countries are now helping us.\xc2\xa0 And we stopped those payments, by the way.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t pay those countries that money anymore.\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you, if they\xe2\x80\x99re as good as they seem to be \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things. So, with that, we had a tremendous three days.\xc2\xa0 It was beautiful to see.\xc2\xa0 Made a lot of new friends.\xc2\xa0 I read you a list of all the countries I saw pretty much one on one.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been very busy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been very, very fruitful. So we could take a couple of questions. I\xe2\x80\x99d love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at UNGA, instead of the witch hunt \xe2\x80\x94 the phony witch hunt questions, which I know that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want to ask because it\xe2\x80\x99s probably better for you, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not better for the country. So maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a few \xe2\x80\x94 a few questions.\xc2\xa0 Please. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 You suggested that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wrong in the course of your conversations with the Ukrainian President.\xc2\xa0 But can you explain to the American people why it is appropriate for an American President to ask a foreign leader for information about a political rival, and what you would have said if you discovered that Barack Obama perhaps had asked a foreign leader for information about you before your campaign for the presidency? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he did, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, really?\xc2\xa0 When you think about it. Look, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully that\xe2\x80\x99ll all come out.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s been some fantastic books written that just came out \xe2\x80\x94 whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s book that just \xe2\x80\x94 just came out recently, and so many other books.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to this country is a disgrace.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt this country very badly.\xc2\xa0 And no other President should have to go through what I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through. The President \xe2\x80\x94 the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption.\xc2\xa0 I just told you about senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 You take a look at that call; it was perfect.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden and there was with these senators.\xc2\xa0 And they threatened.\xc2\xa0 They said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou do this, you do that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give you votes.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s the real deal. So we have an honest group of people that have been maligned.\xc2\xa0 And, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 a lot of people say I\xe2\x80\x99ll do even better.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, I guess we had a 53 poll, and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything.\xc2\xa0 Anybody voting for Trump, you can add \xe2\x80\x94 anytime you get a poll, you can add 10 points or 7 points or 6 points.\xc2\xa0 Take it any way you want.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way it is a compliment. And I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened in the last election: Far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why should the American people then be comfortable with an American President asking a foreign leader for information about an American citizen? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you can look at your senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people.\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is corruption.\xc2\xa0 An investigation started, called the \xe2\x80\x9cRussian witch hunt,\xe2\x80\x9d affectionately.\xc2\xa0 And it was a total phony scam.\xc2\xa0 It was set up by people within the government to try and stop somebody from getting elected. And after that person \xe2\x80\x94 namely, me \xe2\x80\x94 won, and convincingly won at 306 to 223 in the Electoral College \xe2\x80\x94 which, by the way, when you run a race, if you\xe2\x80\x99re running electoral \xe2\x80\x94 you know, if you go by the College, Electoral College, that\xe2\x80\x99s a much different race than running popular vote.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s like the hundred-yard dash or the mile.\xc2\xa0 You train differently. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it that my opponent didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it is.\xc2\xa0 We won election, convincingly.\xc2\xa0 Convincingly.\xc2\xa0 And then you had the text message on, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t win, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an insurance policy.\xe2\x80\x9d How bad was that?\xc2\xa0 You know the insurance policy?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years \xe2\x80\x94 the insurance policy. No, there are a lot of very dishonest people.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the ones that played it straight.\xc2\xa0 And you know what?\xc2\xa0 The millions of people out there that are looking at what\xe2\x80\x99s going on \xe2\x80\x94 those people understand it.\xc2\xa0 They see it.\xc2\xa0 And they think it\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting.\xc2\xa0 And our people are being hurt, and our country is being hurt. When Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left socialists, or worse, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bad.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bad \xe2\x80\x94 especially when the senators and all of these other people have actually done what they\xe2\x80\x99re accusing me of doing, which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have Mike Pompeo say a couple of words.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a couple of more questions. SECRETARY POMPEO:\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d start by talking about Iran.\xc2\xa0 We had a productive week.\xc2\xa0 We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran, just as President Trump and I had been saying, and have now joined us in saying that the existing JCPOA framework is not going to work, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to solve the world\xe2\x80\x99s problems, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to create Middle East stability. Then we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well.\xc2\xa0 The President joined for a meeting of the GCC where we talked again about how we can help deter.\xc2\xa0 We want peace.\xc2\xa0 We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hoping we can get that way.\xc2\xa0 In the end, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be up to the Iranians to make that decision, whether they\xe2\x80\x99ll choose violence and hate \xe2\x80\x94 and the President said in his speech yesterday to the General Assembly \xe2\x80\x94 if their bloodthirst will continue. We hope that\xe2\x80\x99s the (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that\xe2\x80\x99s good for both of them, for the United States, to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can\xe2\x80\x99t foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here over these past few days.\xc2\xa0 Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Thank you. SECRETARY MNUCHIN:\xc2\xa0 As Secretary Pompeo said on Iran, we had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure, and unity on the sanctions program.\xc2\xa0 The Europeans made it very clear they would not do anything without our consent. And then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings: Secretary Ross, Larry Kudlow; Ambassador Lighthizer just left to go back to D.C.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s working hard on trying to get USMCA passed.\xc2\xa0 But we had a lot of productive discussions.\xc2\xa0 The Japanese trade deal and a lot of discussions on investing in the U.S., more jobs in the U.S., and more trade.\xc2\xa0 Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, please. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Kristina Partsinevelos, Fox Business.\xc2\xa0 I want to focus on markets, because I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to everybody else to talk about impeachment.\xc2\xa0 Markets reacted positively after you spoke about China, and that it would happen sooner than \xe2\x80\x94 rather than unexpectedly. Yet, you have the Foreign Minister of China saying that they have no intention of, you know, unseating the United States.\xc2\xa0 And yet, they\xe2\x80\x99re investing heavily in infrastructure and military. PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Not anymore, maybe. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what \xe2\x80\x94 what is different this time, though? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 And maybe they just say that, Kristina. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is different this time, though?\xc2\xa0 The fact that you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s progressing. PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s progressing.\xc2\xa0 I think they want to make a deal.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re losing their supply chain.\xc2\xa0 You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting killed. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have something specific? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that these two men \xe2\x80\x94 and, in this case, more specifically, Steve, we\xe2\x80\x99re having some very good conversations.\r\nAnd I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s next week that a group is coming in and the week after.\xc2\xa0 So we have a lot of \xe2\x80\x94 we have a lot of talks going on, and also by telephone. They want to make a deal.\xc2\xa0 And you know why they want to make a deal?\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re losing their jobs, and because their supply chain is going to hell.\xc2\xa0 And companies are moving out of China, and they\xe2\x80\x99re moving to lots of other places, including the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not good; that\xe2\x80\x99s far worse than they thought. And, by the way, in the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re helping our farmers who got targeted.\xc2\xa0 Now, by the way, China is starting to buy our agricultural product again.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re starting to go with the beef and all of the different things \xe2\x80\x94 pork.\xc2\xa0 Very big on pork. But if you look and if you see \xe2\x80\x94 and they actually put out, I think, a statement.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re starting, very heavy, to buy our ag again.\xc2\xa0 No, they want to make a deal.\xc2\xa0 And they should want to make a deal.\xc2\xa0 The question is: Do we want to make a deal? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If USMCA doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pass through Congress, is that it for NAFTA? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Well, that would be a shame.\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World Trade Organization was not one of the greats.\xc2\xa0 Not one of the greats.\xc2\xa0 That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed.\xc2\xa0 It was \xe2\x80\x94 it was terrible. But, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very interesting question, with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can\xe2\x80\x99t beat us at the ballot.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t beat us at the ballot.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to win the presidential.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re having great polls.\xc2\xa0 We have internal polls that are \xe2\x80\x94 Ohio, Iowa.\xc2\xa0 Pennsylvania is looking good.\xc2\xa0 North Carolina. We just won two races that a lot of people \xe2\x80\x94 we thought we were going to lose both of those races.\xc2\xa0 One was down 17 points three weeks before the race, and he ended up winning by a substantial margin \xe2\x80\x94 by a substantial margin.\xc2\xa0 And \xe2\x80\x94 Dan Bishop. And then we had a second race, as you know, and he was up one or two points and ended up winning by \xe2\x80\x94 what was it?\xc2\xa0 Twenty-five points or some incredible \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you folks because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a front-page story: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have breaking news.\xc2\xa0 Trump exaggerated.\xe2\x80\x9d But he won by many, many points.\xc2\xa0 And he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by \xe2\x80\x94 in the twenties.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s been \xe2\x80\x94 so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking great in North Carolina, looking great in Florida. And you had one or two congressmen Democrats say, \xe2\x80\x9cListen, we can\xe2\x80\x99t beat them at the election, so let\xe2\x80\x99s impeach him.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear \xe2\x80\x94 Al Green.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a beauty.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a real beauty, that guy.\xc2\xa0 But he said, very distinctively, it\xe2\x80\x99s all \xe2\x80\x94 it was all over the place.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to lose that tape, I guess. But he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Essentially, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t beat him.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s impeach him.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty dangerous stuff. Steve, go ahead. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 You had expressed some concerns about the precedent of releasing the transcript. PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did you go ahead and do it? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Because I was getting such fake news, and I just thought it would be better.\xc2\xa0 And now they\xe2\x80\x99re asking for the first phone conversation, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll release that too, if it\xe2\x80\x99s important to you.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re asking for \xe2\x80\x94 because I had a conversation previous \xe2\x80\x94 on a previous election plateau that he had hit.\xc2\xa0 The \xe2\x80\x94 the current president hit a couple of different plateaus. \xc2\xa0And I spoke to him, previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent call \xe2\x80\x94 very, very innocent; very nice call. And as he said, we were \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pushed.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pushed,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning pressured.\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pressured at all. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the concept of releasing calls because when a president or prime minister, or a king or a queen, calls the United States, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say, \xe2\x80\x9cGee, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to release your call to the fake-news media, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make you look like a fool.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What happens is, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to do business that way.\xc2\xa0 You want to have people feel comfortable. So I hated it, but you folks were saying such lies, such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Lindsey Graham said to me, when he read it \xe2\x80\x94 it was very interesting.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a good man.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a smart man.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.\xc2\xa0 I never knew you could be this, really, nice to a person.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot believe it.\xc2\xa0 You were so nice.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you had that in you to be so nice.\xe2\x80\x9d I was nice.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m nice to a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 People don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that.\xc2\xa0 But I was.\xc2\xa0 But he was shocked that it was such a nice call.\xc2\xa0 There \xe2\x80\x94 he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing here.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And all fair people say the same thing. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the precedent, Steve.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it where you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with heads of state and to think that their call is going to be released.\xc2\xa0 But I felt that \xe2\x80\x94 and, you know, we spoke to Ukraine about it.\xc2\xa0 Mike actually called up his counterpart, and we spoke to Ukraine about it because we want to \xe2\x80\x94 because they could have been \xe2\x80\x94 if that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want us to do it, we would not have done it. But he actually said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a very innocent call.\xc2\xa0 You can release it all you want.\xe2\x80\x9d Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you now braced for long impeachment saga? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Well, I thought we won.\xc2\xa0 I thought it was dead.\xc2\xa0 It was dead.\xc2\xa0 The Mueller report \xe2\x80\x94 no obstruction, no collusion.\xc2\xa0 You look at all of the things that happened. Corey Lewandowski was fantastic the other day, as a person that they have been tormenting.\xc2\xa0 You look at all the people that they\xe2\x80\x99ve tormented, all the legal fees.\xc2\xa0 People came here with bright eyes; they wanted to make life so great for other people.\xc2\xa0 And they left where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a sad thing.\xc2\xa0 What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people with only good intention.\xc2\xa0 They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place.\xc2\xa0 And they went home \xe2\x80\x94 they were dark.\xc2\xa0 They got hit by Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s subpoenas.\xc2\xa0 I think there were 2,500 subpoenas, or some ridiculous number.\xc2\xa0 Five hundred people were interviewed, and yet, they don\xe2\x80\x99t interview Joe Biden and his son. If you\xe2\x80\x99re Democrat, you have automatic protection.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s years and years of people putting in certain people into positions.\xc2\xa0 But when you look at all of the \xe2\x80\x94 all of the trauma that these fakers, of course \xe2\x80\x94 and the press \xe2\x80\x94 look, the press is \xe2\x80\x94 much of the press is not only fake, it\xe2\x80\x99s corrupt.\xc2\xa0 These stories they write are corrupt; they\xe2\x80\x99re so wrong.\xc2\xa0 And they know that. You know, it used to be \xe2\x80\x94 I used to get great press until I ran for politics.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I used to be the king of getting good press.\xc2\xa0 I was very good at it.\xc2\xa0 And I got good.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they covered me well for what \xe2\x80\x94 otherwise, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here. And once I ran, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBoy, this is incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But if you see the way they treat my family \xe2\x80\x94 used to be treated great.\xc2\xa0 My family worked so hard.\xc2\xa0 The people that work with me \xe2\x80\x94 these people \xe2\x80\x94 all of these people, they work so hard.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done such a good \xe2\x80\x94 Look, we have the greatest economy we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had.\xc2\xa0 We have a military \xe2\x80\x94 two and a half trillion dollars.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve rebuilt our military.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t hear the vets complaining.\xc2\xa0 We got Choice approved.\xc2\xa0 It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be approved. But when you see what happened with the viciousness, and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mic \xe2\x80\x94 smart guy, by the way \xe2\x80\x94 stand at the mic and act like he\xe2\x80\x99s so serious.\xc2\xa0 And then he goes into a room with Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off.\xc2\xa0 They must laugh their asses off. But it\xe2\x80\x99s so bad for our country.\xc2\xa0 People have said \xe2\x80\x94 Rush Limbaugh \xe2\x80\x94 great man; Sean Hannity said it.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people have said it.\xc2\xa0 Mark Levin.\xc2\xa0 They said they don\xe2\x80\x99t know if one man anywhere in the world, with all the men they know \xe2\x80\x94 or woman \xe2\x80\x94 that could handle what I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to handle. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true, but I handle it.\xc2\xa0 To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s like putting on a suit.

Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions \xe2\x80\x94 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 to take advantage of this.\xc2\xa0 Maduro traveled to Russia and Diosdado Cabello to North Korea \xe2\x80\x94 two of the most antagonist nations in the U.S. interests.\xc2\xa0 What can be done to contain this?\xc2\xa0 What are they looking for in that country?\xc2\xa0 And because the special envoy, Mr. Abrams, said that the Russians are willing to negotiate it.\xc2\xa0 This is one question. And the other: Mr. President, you say that the socialists is one of the biggest challenges, you said yesterday in the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 But the region is far from safe.\xc2\xa0 Maduro is still a dictator, full in power.\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) in Argentina and Brazil are on their (inaudible) about the socialist and populist.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried about it? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just say that socialism will never happen in the United States.\xc2\xa0 It can\xe2\x80\x99t happen in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And Venezuela \xe2\x80\x94 unfortunately, I have to use your country as the example of what socialism can do, how it can tear the fabric of a country apart.\xc2\xa0 Because I know a lot about Venezuela. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had many, many friends of mine come from Venezuela.\xc2\xa0 They live \xe2\x80\x94 many in Miami \xe2\x80\x94 a certain section of Miami, I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention the name because they\xe2\x80\x99ll say I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about my business, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 But they are fantastic people and they like your President.\xc2\xa0 They voted overwhelmingly for me.\xc2\xa0 They like what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing for Venezuela. We have Venezuela very much in our hearts and very much in our sights.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re watching it very carefully.\xc2\xa0 And you know what I would say?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re giving millions and millions of dollars in aid \xe2\x80\x94 not that we want to, from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to because, on a humanitarian \xe2\x80\x94 people are dying.\xc2\xa0 They have no food.\xc2\xa0 They have no water.\xc2\xa0 They have no nothing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re dying.\xc2\xa0 No medicine.\xc2\xa0 Their hospitals are closed or \xe2\x80\x94 or don\xe2\x80\x99t even have electricity.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s so sad to see. Let me just say that we have it under control.\xc2\xa0 We are watching it very carefully.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be very, very \xe2\x80\x94 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russia (inaudible) \xe2\x80\x94 PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re watching it very carefully, including other countries that may or may not be playing games.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re watching it very closely. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, you know, if Russia is talking with the USA or Guaid\xc3\xb3, what can you tell \xe2\x80\x94 about us? PRESIDENT TRUMP:\xc2\xa0 Just put this in the back of your mind: It\xe2\x80\x99s all going to be fine.\xc2\xa0 We know everything that you said, and it\xe2\x80\x99s all going to be fine.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very much involved.\xc2\xa0 We very much know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, and we\xe2\x80\x99re very much involved.\xc2\xa0 Okay?
