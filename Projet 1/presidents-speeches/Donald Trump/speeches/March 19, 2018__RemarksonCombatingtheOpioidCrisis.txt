b'THE PRESIDENT: Thank you to our First Lady, Melania, who has been so incredible. (Applause.) Thank you. And we are blessed to have you as our First Lady. Really are. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be back in the beautiful state of New Hampshire. (Applause.) I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you remember, but this is the first place I came for the primaries. (Applause.) And this is the room right here. So I like this room. This has been a good room. We\xe2\x80\x99re honored to be joined by your wonderful and very talented Governor, Chris Sununu. Chris, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Chris. Oh, and there\xe2\x80\x99s another talented governor. Governor Sununu, stand up. (Applause.) I have to tell you, there was nobody tougher on Trump at the beginning. (Laughter.) It\xe2\x80\x99s true. There was nobody on television tougher. And then we met each other and we liked each other, and he went from the worst to the best. Governor, thank you. (Laughs.) I mean that, too. Thank you. I want to thank also Attorney General Sessions, and Secretary\xe2\x80\x94thank you, Jeff.\xe2\x80\x94(applause)\xe2\x80\x94Secretary Azar, Secretary Nielsen, and Surgeon General Adams for joining us at this very important event. The First Lady and I just visited the Manchester Fire Department Safe Station. Talking about it all over the country. The Fire Chief, Dan Goonan, and all of the first responders with us today, thank you. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been incredible, and you\xe2\x80\x99re saving American lives. We\xe2\x80\x99re also joined by a number of law enforcement officers who we love. Our police, DEA, ICE, Border Patrol agents, and Customs officers work night and day to keep drugs out of our communities and criminals off of our streets. (Applause.) So today, we thank you, we honor you, and we want you to know that we will always have your backs 100 percent. Thank you very much, law enforcement. Thank you. (Applause.) I especially want to acknowledge all of the families with us today who have endured terrible hardships because of the opioid crisis, and especially those who have lost precious loved ones. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying this for a long time, and it all started right here in New Hampshire, because I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re going through. About as bad as there is anywhere in the country. And I said I\xe2\x80\x99d be back, and we are back. And we\xe2\x80\x99re pouring a lot of money and a lot of talent into this horrible problem. And we pledge to honor the memory of those you lost with action and determination and resolve. We\xe2\x80\x99ll get it. We will not rest until the end. And I will tell you, this scourge of drug addiction in America will stop. It will stop. (Applause.) Every day, 116 Americans die from an opioid-related overdose. In New Hampshire, the overdose, really, death rate\xe2\x80\x94I mean, can you believe this? The death rate is double the national average. It\xe2\x80\x99s got difficulties like people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe. Defeating this epidemic will require the commitment of every state, local, and federal agency. Failure is not an option. Addiction is not our future. We will liberate our country from this crisis. Never been like this. Hundreds of years\xe2\x80\x94never been like this. And we will raise a drug-free generation of American children. Last October, we declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Should have been done a long time before. Since then, we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with Congress to ensure at least 6 billion additional dollars, going through right now, in new funding in 2018 and 2019 to combat the opioid crisis. And we will be spending the most money ever on the opioid crisis. (Applause.) On our most recent National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, people across the country turned in more than 900,000 pounds of unused or expired prescription drugs\xe2\x80\x94more than the weight of three Boeing 757s. Our Customs and Border Protection\xe2\x80\x94and these people, the job they do is incredible\xe2\x80\x94seized nearly 1,500 pounds of fentanyl last year, nearly three times the amount seized in 2016. And I told China: Don\xe2\x80\x99t send it. (Applause.) And I told Mexico: Don\xe2\x80\x99t send it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t send it. In 2017, ICE arrested criminal aliens with 76,000 charges and convictions for dangerous drug crimes. Last year, the Department of Justice prosecuted more than 3,000 defendants in cases involving opioid, all of the trafficking, and the related crimes\xe2\x80\x943,000 cases\xe2\x80\x94including a pharmacist, a physician\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, and an opioid trafficker, each charged with committing serious drug crimes in New Hampshire. Whether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you, we will arrest you, and we will hold you accountable. (Applause.) Thank you. Here in New Hampshire, I applaud all of the Drug Enforcement Agents and law enforcement officers who recently coordinated Operation Granite Shield, an 18-hour enforcement action targeting drug traffickers that resulted in the arrest of 151 people. These are terrible people, and we have to get tough on those people, because we can have all the Blue Ribbon committees we want, but if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get tough on the drug dealers, we\xe2\x80\x99re wasting our time. Just remember that. We\xe2\x80\x99re wasting our time. And that toughness includes the death penalty. (Applause.) You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing thing. Some of these drug dealers will kill thousands of people during their lifetime\xe2\x80\x94thousands of people\xe2\x80\x94and destroy many more lives than that. But they will kill thousands of people during their lifetime, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll get caught and they\xe2\x80\x99ll get 30 days in jail. Or they\xe2\x80\x99ll go away for a year, or they\xe2\x80\x99ll be fined. And yet, if you kill one person, you get the death penalty or you go to jail for life. So if we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kills thousands of people and destroy so many people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, we are just doing the wrong thing. We have got to get tough. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about nice anymore. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about committees. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t about let\xe2\x80\x99s get everybody and have dinners, and let\xe2\x80\x99s have everybody go to a Blue Ribbon committee and everybody gets a medal for, frankly, talking and doing nothing. This is about winning a very, very tough problem. And if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get very tough on these dealers, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen, folks. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen. And I want to win this battle. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave at the end of seven years and have this problem, okay? (Applause.) I don\xe2\x80\x99t want that. Right? Thank you. Not going to happen. Thank you all. A lot of voters in this room. I see that. Thank you. (Applause.) No, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve this problem. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve it with brains, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve it with resolve, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve it with toughness. Because toughness is the thing that they most fear. That\xe2\x80\x99s what they most fear. So to the brave agents and officers, thank you for protecting us all. Last year, my commission on combatting the incredible crisis of opioids issued 56 recommendations. My administration agreed with all of the commission\xe2\x80\x99s goals, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked aggressively to put them into action. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m here to announce additional steps that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking as part of our nationwide initiative to address the opioid crisis, and, by the way, the drug crisis\xe2\x80\x94the general drug crisis. First, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking action to reduce drug demand by preventing Americans from becoming addicted in the first place. So important. That includes increasing federal funding for the development of non-addictive painkillers. And we have to come up with a solution where we come up with a painkiller that\xe2\x80\x99s not so addictive. And we can do it. We\xe2\x80\x99re not that far off. We can do it. These things are incredibly addictive. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find that answer also. Here with us today are Jim and Jean Mozer. They lost their beautiful son, Adam, to a fentanyl overdose. His addiction began with prescription pills he found in their kitchen cabinet. They have since begun the Zero Left initiative to help families get rid of excess painkillers. Jim and Jean, we\xe2\x80\x99re sorry for your loss\xe2\x80\x94a great boy; he\xe2\x80\x99s a great boy\xe2\x80\x94and we applaud your strength and your leadership. And where are you? Where are you? Come on up. Come on up here. Come on up here. (Applause.) Tell us about your boy. MS. MOZER: Adam was our oldest son. He was a great kid. He was a smart kid. Grew up out in rural East Kingston, New Hampshire. He had a degree in actuarial science, which, as many of you know, that\xe2\x80\x99s the science of forecasting risk. He was the kind of kid that made you feel really good about yourself. You give him five minutes; you really liked him. And, you know, he just made a bad choice one night. As smart as he was, he found his way into our kitchen cabinet. And, sadly, the rest is history. He got hooked on it, and had to go to the street eventually. And he found fentanyl. And he\xe2\x80\x99s been gone for two-and-a-half years, and we miss him every day. Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, darling. You take care of yourself. Okay? MS. MOZER: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Appreciate it. And so many cases like that. We\xe2\x80\x99re also taking action to prevent addiction by addressing the problem of overprescribing. (Applause.) And our Department of Justice is looking very seriously into bringing major litigation against some of these drug companies. We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring it at a federal level. (Applause.) Some states are already bringing it, but we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about bringing it at a very high federal level. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a job. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years. We\xe2\x80\x99re also going to make sure that virtually all prescriptions reimbursed by the federal government follow best practices for prescribing. We\xe2\x80\x99ll ensure that opioid addiction is not subsidized by the American taxpayer. (Applause.) The best way\xe2\x80\x94so important\xe2\x80\x94and the best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with. As part of that effort\xe2\x80\x94(applause)\xe2\x80\x94so important. And this has been something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very strongly in favor of: spending a lot of money on great commercials showing how bad it is, so that kids seeing those commercials during the right shows on television or wherever\xe2\x80\x94the Internet\xe2\x80\x94when they see these commercials they\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want any part of it.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s the least expensive thing we can do, where you scare them from ending up like the people in the commercials. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll make them very, very bad commercials. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make them pretty unsavory situations. And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it before, and it\xe2\x80\x99s had an impact on smoking and cigarettes. You see what happens to the body; you see what happens to the mind. So we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing a new website, CrisisNextDoor.gov, where Americans can share their stories about the danger of the opioid addiction and addictions.\r\nBut we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about doing, really, a largescale rollout of commercials that show how bad it is for the kids. And when they see those commercials, hopefully, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be going to drugs of any kind\xe2\x80\x94drugs of any kind. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll save a lot of lives, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make their life a lot easier. This epidemic can affect anyone, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we want to educate everyone.\r\nThe second part of our initiative is to reduce the supply of illicit drugs. Ninety percent of the heroin in America comes from our southern border, where, eventually, the Democrats will agree with us and we\xe2\x80\x99ll build the wall to keep the damn drugs out. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! THE PRESIDENT: It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty amazing. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go with DACA, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t care about DACA. But they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to tie the wall to DACA, and DACA to the wall. And they want to keep DACA for the campaign instead of getting it approved, which we could do very easily. The Republicans are totally in favor of doing something substantial for DACA. But the Democrats like it as a campaign issue, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t get it approved. And they want to tie it to the wall, which is okay with me. But both should get approved. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to be approved. Remember what I said: They don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to be approved. They want to make it part of the campaign. Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it part of the campaign, also. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll win, because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to win on those issues. (Applause.) My administration is also confronting things called \xe2\x80\x9csanctuary cities\xe2\x80\x9d that shield dangerous criminals. And every day, sanctuary cities release illegal immigrants and drug dealers, traffickers, and gang members back into our communities. They\xe2\x80\x99re protected by these cities. And you say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they doing?\xe2\x80\x9d They\xe2\x80\x99re safe havens for just some terrible people. Some terrible people. And they\xe2\x80\x99re making it very dangerous for our law enforcement officers. You see it all the time. As the people of New Hampshire have learned firsthand, ending sanctuary cities is crucial to stopping the drug addiction crisis. And your governor, who is great\xe2\x80\x94the numbers are going down in New Hampshire. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, but the numbers are going down. Chris, we were just\xe2\x80\x94stand up, Chris. (Applause.) It\xe2\x80\x99s really one of the few bright spots where the numbers actually are going down, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous achievement. Thank you, Chris. (Applause.) According to a recent Dartmouth study, the sanctuary city of Lawrence, Massachusetts is one of the primary sources of fentanyl in six New Hampshire counties. ICE recently arrested 15 MS-13 gang members\xe2\x80\x94these are not good people, folks. Okay? These are bad, bad people. They don\xe2\x80\x99t use guns. They\xe2\x80\x99d rather use knives because it\xe2\x80\x99s more painful and it takes longer. These are bad people\xe2\x80\x94in Boston, Massachusetts, which is a place where you have sanctuary cities. I\xe2\x80\x99m repeating my call on Congress to block funds for sanctuary cities and to close the deadly loopholes that allow criminals back into our country and into our country in the first place. (Applause.) You know, some things are very understandable. We have lots of issues where we\xe2\x80\x99re on both sides of an issue, and you can understand the other side even though you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree. Sanctuary cities are hard to understand for people because they don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. They don\xe2\x80\x99t get it. You see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in California, how terrible it is, how dangerous it is. And they\xe2\x80\x99re all trying to protect sanctuary cities. And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Kate Steinle or so many others, they\xe2\x80\x99d be around today if these people weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed back into our country through, in this case, the southern border, at least five times. And look at the damage, and then look at this verdict. Look at the verdict. Can you believe the verdict? So we have to get a lot smarter. We have to get a lot tougher. And speaking of tough, because here with us today is ICE Agent Derek Dunn. Derek worked with state police to uncover a major drug smuggling operation in Lawrence, Massachusetts. (Applause.) Where\xe2\x80\x99s Derek? Derek. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Derek? Come here, Derek. I love tough guys. We need tough guys. Come here, Derek. (Applause.)\r\nAGENT DUNN: Just want to say thanks for everyone being here. And it\xe2\x80\x99s been a battle. It\xe2\x80\x99s been an absolute battle for our counterparts here at DEA and FBI and everybody\xe2\x80\x94all the law enforcement, state police, and the local police. It\xe2\x80\x99s been an absolute battle. We all work together, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get this solved. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was going to do that. (Laughter.) And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you were going to do that. But that\xe2\x80\x99s in honor of your boy, right? You made a big impact. I also want to mention ICE Agent Ron Morin and Manchester Police Detective Patrick Maguire. They helped lead the team that arrested a terrible human trafficker who used opioids to harm, in a very violent way, his victims. Thank you both for bringing the trafficker to a very strong and swift justice.\r\nWhere are you guys? Thank you. (Applause.) Stand up, fellas. Thank you. Thank you. We\xe2\x80\x99re also shutting down illegal online marketplaces and preventing drugs that come from China and other countries from bypassing our borders. And we\xe2\x80\x99re getting very tough on it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that we have a choice. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice. We can be nice, and we can be soft and weak, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have a country left. So we have to strengthen up, and strengthen up our laws so that we can do what we have to do. We have to stop this from happening. Drug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why my Department of Justice will be seeking so many much tougher penalties than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had, and we will be focusing on the penalty that I talked about previously for the big pushers, the ones that are really killing so many people. And that penalty is going to be the death penalty. (Applause.) If you look at\xe2\x80\x94if you look at other countries\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to know the leaders of many countries. And I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention names, but you know the countries I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about. I go around, \xe2\x80\x9cHow is your drug problem?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a drug problem.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a drug problem?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xe2\x80\x9d I say, how come? \xe2\x80\x9cWe have zero tolerance for drug dealers.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThat means we have the death penalty for drug dealers. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a drug problem.\xe2\x80\x9d Take a look at some of these countries where they don\xe2\x80\x99t play games. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have a drug problem. We have court cases that last 10 years, and then they get out at the end. We got to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to change the laws, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working on that right now. The Department of Justice is working very, very hard on that. But the ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty. Now, maybe our country is not ready for that. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that our country is not ready for that. And I can understand it, maybe. Although, personally, I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand that. But there are people that are good people, that are strong, smart people, and they would differ with most of us. But I think unless you do that, unless you have really, really powerful penalties, led by the death penalty for the really bad pushers and abusers, we are going to get nowhere. And I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, we are going to get somewhere. Companies must also be held accountable. The Department of Justice recently created a task force to coordinate investigations and lawsuits against manufacturers and other bad actors that harm our citizens. And I can tell you that Jeff Sessions, who\xe2\x80\x99s here with us now, feels so strongly about this. And they\xe2\x80\x99re working very hard and very effectively on that, and so we appreciate that very much. Thank you. Thank you, Jeff. (Applause.) Thank you. I can think of nothing more important. The third part of our initiative is to get lifesaving help to those who need it. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure our first responders have access to lifesaving overdose-reversing drugs\xe2\x80\x94which, by the way, are amazing. Here with us today is Mike Kelly, the president of Adapt Pharma. Adapt Pharma makes an overdose-reversing drug for opioids, which I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched and seen work. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Narcan. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually incredible. Today, we applaud Adapt Pharma\xe2\x80\x99s decision to provide free\xe2\x80\x94free\xe2\x80\x94Narcan to all high schools, colleges, and universities in America. I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to come up, Mike. Come up. (Applause.) Where\xe2\x80\x99s Mike? Come up, Mike. That\xe2\x80\x99s really an amazing and generous offer. Thank you. Tell us a little bit about that, Mike. Please. MR. KELLY: So, Adapt is a small company that has a big job, which is to reverse overdoses. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided, free of charge, four boxes to all colleges and universities in the United States; two boxes free for every high school in the United States; as well as educational awareness for the nursing departments, as well as the faculty to train and teach everybody about the dangers of opioids and the risks, and also the benefits of having Narcan nasal spray near where opioids are. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. MR. KELLY: Thank you. Appreciate it. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing, generous. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched the police and the fire\xe2\x80\x94they come around and they\xe2\x80\x99ve become so good at it. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people that are just about dead wake up. Now, the problem is, they then go back, in many cases, to the drugs, and they do it again and again and again. But we have to work on that. We have to work on that very, very strongly. I also want to recommend and commend a Richmond-based company, Kal\xc3\xa9o, for donating more than 300,000 doses of their overdose-reversing drug to first responders, which has already saved more than 5,000 lives in a very short period of time. My administration has made clear that medical providers can share crucial information with family members about an overdose so that their loved ones can help them get into treatment. We need treatment. We\xe2\x80\x99re making medically assisted treatment more available and affordable, and we continue to increase competition and drive down drug prices. And we\xe2\x80\x99re driving them down. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a major news conference, probably at the White House, in about a month, because all of you people\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about prescription drugs, not necessarily the drugs that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here. But we pay, as a country, so much more for drugs because of the drug lobbies and other reasons, and the complexity of distribution, which is basically another term for saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we get more money?\xe2\x80\x9d And if you compare our drug prices to other countries in the world, in some cases it\xe2\x80\x99s many times higher for the exact same pill, or whatever it is, in the exact same package, made in the exact same plant. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to change that. And I would like to ask Secretary Azar just to come up and mention opioid, but also talk about how we\xe2\x80\x99re getting your drug prices down. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve already saved billions of dollars for our country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in much lower drug prices. Watch what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen over a short period of time. This man is one of the great professionals, ran an incredibly successful drug company. Who knows better than the guy running the drug company, Eli Lilly? That\xe2\x80\x99s your company, right? Or was. SECRETARY AZAR: It was. THE PRESIDENT: Now you\xe2\x80\x99re on the other side, though. So nobody knows better. The most respected man in that industry\xe2\x80\x94and we got him to work, because he loves our country. Would you tell them a little bit about what you have planned for drug prices and also opioids, in terms of stoppage? Please. Secretary. (Applause.) SECRETARY AZAR: Well, thank you, Mr. President. And, you know, you\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot already to tackle this issue of drug pricing. So, last year, the FDA approved more generic drugs than it ever has in its history. And that brings prices down for patients, for the system, for everybody. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Great. SECRETARY AZAR: You also changed the rules so our senior citizens pay less out of pocket for their drugs. That\xe2\x80\x99s $3.2 billion that they\xe2\x80\x99re paying less out of pocket for their drugs when they go to the pharmacy. (Applause.) And then, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be rolling out, as you mentioned, in about a month, a whole slate of other proposals around how we decrease the price of drugs and how we bring discounts that the middlemen right now are getting; how those will go to our patients, to individuals. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re attacking this with the same level of action, determination, and resolve that you\xe2\x80\x99re bring to the opioid crisis. And that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on prevention and getting that one-third fewer illegal opioid prescriptions to our people. The second is the stopping the illicit flow of these opioids into our country. And the third is compassionate treatment for people\xe2\x80\x94evidence-based, science-based, compassionate treatment\xe2\x80\x94that can help people recover and stay away from relapse. So, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Alex. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing drug prices falling very substantially in the not-too-distant future, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be beautiful.\r\nAnd I want to thank, also, Scott Gottlieb. Scott is working on different things, but one of them is called \xe2\x80\x9cRight to Try.\xe2\x80\x9d Do you know what \xe2\x80\x9cRight to Try\xe2\x80\x9d is? These are for people that are terminally ill. And there are very, very good-looking combinations of things, or pills, medicines, potential cures. And they\xe2\x80\x99re terminal, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be living much longer. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right to give them these experimental drugs or these early-stage drugs that really show promise, for whatever reason. But they say because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to harm somebody, if you can believe it. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to harm. So the people will oftentimes go to foreign lands, foreign countries. They\xe2\x80\x99ll do anything. They want hope. They want hope. \xe2\x80\x9cRight to Try.\xe2\x80\x9d So we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Congressman Greg Walden and numerous other senators and congressmen. And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have good luck. The Democrats have been pushing back on it, but I think many of them are also coming along. It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cRight to Try.\xe2\x80\x9d A patient is terminal. There\xe2\x80\x99s good progress made with a certain drug. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make it possible for that patient to get that drug. And maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s going to work. It\xe2\x80\x99s hope. It\xe2\x80\x99s incredible; they\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this for years and years and years. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to get it approved. So important. All right? (Applause.) To further expand treatment, I\xe2\x80\x99m also calling on Congress to change the restrictive 1970s-era law that prevents Medicaid from paying for care at certain treatment facilities with more than 16 beds. It\xe2\x80\x99s such an important factor. In the meantime, my administration is granting waivers to states so they can help people who need treatment now, Governor. We\xe2\x80\x99re also going to help inmates leaving prison get treatment so they can have a second chance to become productive, law-abiding citizens. And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve really done for the inmates\xe2\x80\x94you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard for them to get out of jail and get a job. What we\xe2\x80\x99ve really done for them\xe2\x80\x94better than anything we can sign, any legislation that we can pass demanding that you hire\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a great economy. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been this good in many, many years. Some people say it\xe2\x80\x99s never been this good. And what\xe2\x80\x99s happened is, as you see, unemployment is way down, and people are starting to hire inmates. And the results are incredible. Some of these employers are calling up, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWow, what great people.\xe2\x80\x9d We\xe2\x80\x99re giving them a second chance. It\xe2\x80\x99s very, very important. So the tremendous economy is helping us very much with that program. We want every American\xe2\x80\x94(applause)\xe2\x80\x94thank you. We want every American to be able to be able to reach their full God-given potential. And we will succeed together as one people, one nation, and one great American family. Because Americans never give in, and we never, ever give up. This group never gives up, right? Never give up. Your boy. (Applause.) The brave families here today remind us that the strength of America is found in the heart of our people. We see America\xe2\x80\x99s heart in the parents who won\xe2\x80\x99t accept addiction as the fate of their children. And if something horrible has befallen that family, they go around and they want to make sure it never happens to another family. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we thank you so much, and we thank your boy. (Applause.) He did not die in vain. We see it in sons and daughters who cheer on moms and dads as they recover. We see it in the doctors and nurses who provide constant and loving care. We see it in the heroic law enforcement officers who race into unimaginable danger. We see it in EMTs and firefighters who act so quickly to save so many lives. And we see this American heart in the men and women who fight every day to help rescue their fellow citizens from the grips of addiction. These are the courageous souls who remind us that, for America, there is nothing beyond our reach. Nothing at all. (Applause.) Nothing. We will defeat this crisis, we will protect our beautiful children, and we will ensure that tomorrow is better, brighter, stronger, and greater than ever before. Because as long as we have trust in our citizens, pride in our country, and faith in our God, we will not fail. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Together, we will end the scourge of drug addiction in America once and for all. We will win. We will beat it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be tough. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be smart. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be kind. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be loving. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever we have to do. But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to win. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you.'
