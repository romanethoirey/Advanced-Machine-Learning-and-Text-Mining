b"THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Matt, for that great introduction. And thank you for this big crowd. This is incredible. Really incredible. (Applause.) We\xe2\x80\x99ve all come a long way together. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way together. I\xe2\x80\x99m thrilled to be back at CPAC, with so many of my wonderful friends and amazing supporters, and proud conservatives. (Applause.) Remember when I first started running? Because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a politician, fortunately. But do you remember I started running and people would say, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure he\xe2\x80\x99s a conservative?\xe2\x80\x9d I think now we\xe2\x80\x99ve proved that I\xe2\x80\x99m a conservative, right? (Applause.) For more than four decades, this event has served as a forum for our nation\xe2\x80\x99s top leaders, activists, writers, thinkers. Year after year, leaders have stood on this stage to discuss what we can do together to protect our heritage, to promote our culture, and to defend our freedom. CPAC has always been about big ideas and it\xe2\x80\x99s also been about putting those ideas into action. And CPAC really has put a lot of ideas into action. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about some of them this morning. For the last year, with your help, we have put more great conservative ideas into use than perhaps ever before in American history. (Applause.) Right? By the way, what a nice picture that is. Look at that. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to watch that guy speak. (Laughter.) Oh, boy. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\xe2\x80\x94I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks. I work hard at it. (Applause.) It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look bad. Hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re hanging in. We\xe2\x80\x99re hanging in. We\xe2\x80\x99re hanging in there, right? Together, we\xe2\x80\x99re hanging in. We\xe2\x80\x99ve confirmed a record number\xe2\x80\x94so important\xe2\x80\x94of circuit court judges, and we are going to be putting in a lot more. (Applause.) And they will interpret the law as written. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve confirmed an incredible new Supreme Court justice, a great man, Neil Gorsuch. (Applause.) Right? We\xe2\x80\x99ve passed massive\xe2\x80\x94biggest in history\xe2\x80\x94tax cuts and reforms. (Applause.) You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t use the word \xe2\x80\x9creform.\xe2\x80\x9d There was a lot of reform, too. Very positive reform. I don\xe2\x80\x99t use it. And when we were first doing it, I told everybody\xe2\x80\x94everybody gathered\xe2\x80\x94I said, \xe2\x80\x9cJust talk about tax cuts. People don\xe2\x80\x99t know what reform means. They think reform might mean it\xe2\x80\x99s going up.\xe2\x80\x9d And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo tax cuts.\xe2\x80\x9d AUDIENCE: Booo \xe2\x80\x94 AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. How did he get in here, Matt? Boy. Okay. Just for the media, the fake news back there, they took very good care of him. They were very gentle. (Laughter.) He was very obnoxious. It was only one person. So we have thousands of people here. (Applause.) So listen\xe2\x80\x94tomorrow, the headline will be, \xe2\x80\x9cProtestors disturbed the Trump\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one person, folks. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve a mention. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve a headline. The headline tomorrow: \xe2\x80\x9cDisrupters of CPAC.\xe2\x80\x9d One person. And he was very nice\xe2\x80\x94we looked at him, and he immediately left. Okay. (Laughter and applause.) No, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had it too often. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have one person, and you can hardly even hear him. In fact, the biggest, really, disturbance are you people. You know why? He\xe2\x80\x99ll say something; nobody hears him. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s all\xe2\x80\x94and then the crowd will start screaming at him. And then all of a sudden we stop for\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You have to show your spirit, right? You have to show your spirit. It\xe2\x80\x99s true. (Applause.) So we passed the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. And it was called \xe2\x80\x9ctax cut and reform.\xe2\x80\x9d And I said to our people, don\xe2\x80\x99t use the word \xe2\x80\x9creform.\xe2\x80\x9d Because we were going to call it the \xe2\x80\x9cTax Reform Act.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo wonder for 45 years nothing has been passed.\xe2\x80\x9d Because people want tax cuts, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what reform means. Reform can mean you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay more tax. So I convinced politicians who have done this all their lives\xe2\x80\x94and they do a great job, in many cases\xe2\x80\x94but this was one\xe2\x80\x94they were going, the \xe2\x80\x9cTax Reform Act\xe2\x80\x9d of whatever year we want to put. Okay? So they have the Tax Reform Act, and that was it. And now it was called the Tax Act\xe2\x80\x94Tax Cut Act and Jobs. We had to add \xe2\x80\x9cjobs\xe2\x80\x9d into it because we\xe2\x80\x99re picking up a tremendous number of jobs\xe2\x80\x942.7 million jobs since the election. 2.7. (Applause.) So now people hear tax cuts, and it has been popular. Remember, it started off a little slow. Then it got passed, and we had some great help. I will say, we had some great help in the Senate, in the House. We have guys here today\xe2\x80\x94we have a lot of congressmen, we have a lot of senators. We had a lot of help. And we got it passed. Just\xe2\x80\x94it was not easy. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one Democrat vote, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost them in the midterms. I know that whoever wins the presidency has a disadvantage, for whatever reason, in the midterms. You know what happens? I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure it out. Because historically, if you win the presidency, you don\xe2\x80\x99t do well two years later. And you know what? We can\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen. (Applause.) And I know what happens. I finally figured it out. Nobody has been able to explain it. It just happens, statistically, almost all of the time for many years. What happens is, you fight so hard to win the presidency. You fight, fight, fight. And now only two years\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s a very short period. And by the time you start campaigning, it\xe2\x80\x99s a year. And now you got to go and fight again. But you just won. So nobody has that same drive that they had. So you end up not doing that well because the other side is going\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re crazed. And, by the way, they\xe2\x80\x99re crazed anyway, these people. They are really crazed. (Laughter and applause.) Right? So\xe2\x80\x94because I kept trying to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is this?\xe2\x80\x9d But it\xe2\x80\x99s just there. So the great enthusiasm\xe2\x80\x94you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting back, you\xe2\x80\x99re watching television. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to vote today; we just won the presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d And then we get clobbered, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen. We get clobbered in \xe2\x80\x9918, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen\xe2\x80\x94only because we are so happy, we passed so many things. Honestly, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll use the word \xe2\x80\x9cmy administration\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to me\xe2\x80\x94my administration, I think, has had the most successful first year in the history of the presidency. I really believe that. I really believe it. I really believe it. (Applause.) So, I mean, judges, regulations, everything. And the beautiful thing about the tax cuts is nobody thought we could do it. Because again, we had to get 100 percent of our vote. And nobody thought we could do it. And, frankly\xe2\x80\x94I mean, to me we got it and it\xe2\x80\x99s turned out to be one of the most popular things. And, by the way, for the Republicans in this room, of which I assume\xe2\x80\x94would you say, is it 99 percent, Matt, or 100 percent? Huh? I would hope it\xe2\x80\x99s close to\xe2\x80\x94you know what, hey, we probably have some Democrats that want to come over. We have a great governor from West Virginia that left the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x94Big Jim\xe2\x80\x94and he came over to the Republican Party. (Applause.) So people are sitting there, and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, we just had that great victory. Eh, let\xe2\x80\x99s not vote. Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to a movie. We\xe2\x80\x99re the Republican Party, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do great.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they end up losing. So you got to keep up the enthusiasm. Now what happens, by the way, they lose. And then you have the presidential election coming up again, and you clobber them because everybody gets off their ass and they get out and they work. Right? And they work. And they work and work and work. And you end up winning the Presidency again. And we should do that\xe2\x80\x94hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that very easily. But never\xe2\x80\x94we have to worry\xe2\x80\x94right now, we have a big race coming up in \xe2\x80\x9918. You have to get out. You have to just get that enthusiasm. Keep it going. (Applause.) See, the word, really, is \xe2\x80\x9ccomplacent.\xe2\x80\x9d People get complacent. It\xe2\x80\x99s a natural instinct. You just won, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re happy and you\xe2\x80\x99re complacent. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be complacent. Okay? Don\xe2\x80\x99t be complacent. Because if they get in, they will repeal your tax cuts, they will put judges in that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe, they\xe2\x80\x99ll take away your Second Amendment, which we will never allow to happen. (Applause.) They\xe2\x80\x99ll take away your Second Amendment. (Applause). AUDIENCE: Donald Trump! Donald Trump! THE PRESIDENT: Remember that. They will take away\xe2\x80\x94thank you. They will take away those massive tax cuts and they will take away your Second Amendment. By the way, if you only had a choice of one, what would you rather have? The Second Amendment or the tax cuts? Go ahead, Second Amendment, tax cuts. Second Amendment. (Applause.) I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave it at the Second Amendment. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into that battle, all right? We\xe2\x80\x99re going to say you want\xe2\x80\x94Matt, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to say you want the Second Amendment the most. But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get them all. And remember this\xe2\x80\x94(applause)\xe2\x80\x94remember this: We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten\xe2\x80\x94you know, somebody got on television recently and they said, actually, this is the first time I can remember\xe2\x80\x94Trump made campaign promises. He may be the only person that actually fulfilled more promises than he made. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true. (Applause.) I fulfilled more promises. But we have a very crooked media. We had a crooked candidate, too, by the way. But we have a very, very crooked media. AUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up! THE PRESIDENT: I will say this, folks: Everything that\xe2\x80\x99s turning out, now it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing that\xe2\x80\x99s come full circle. Boy, have they committed a lot of atrocities when you look. (Applause.) Right? When you look. Have they done things that are wrong. But remember this: Not only did we get the tax cuts, which everybody said we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get\xe2\x80\x94and, by the way, repealed, in that tax cut, the individual mandate, which is a tremendous thing. (Applause.) This is where you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to pay in order not to have healthcare. Okay? Is that great? You pay for the privilege of not having healthcare. So you\xe2\x80\x99re subsidizing lots of other people. That\xe2\x80\x99s gone. I know people came up to me with tears in their eyes; they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, I\xe2\x80\x99m forced to pay not to have healthcare. Very unfair. And, by the way, we\xe2\x80\x99re having tremendous plans coming out now\xe2\x80\x94healthcare plans\xe2\x80\x94at a fraction of the cost that are much better than Obamacare. (Applause.) And except for one Senator, who came into a room at 3 o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning and went like that\xe2\x80\x94we would have had healthcare, too. AUDIENCE: Booo \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT: We would have had healthcare, too. Think of that. But I think we may be better off the way we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it. It\xe2\x80\x99s piece by piece by piece. Obamacare is just being wiped out. The individual mandate, essentially, wipes it out. (Applause.) So I think we may be better off. And people are getting great healthcare plans and we\xe2\x80\x99re not finished yet. But, remember, one person walked into a room when he was supposed to go this way, and he said he was going this way, and he walked in, and he went this way, and everyone said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened? What was that all about?\xe2\x80\x9d Boy, oh, boy. Who was that? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be controversial, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t use his name. Okay? (Laughter.) What a mess. But it\xe2\x80\x99s all happening anyway. It\xe2\x80\x99s all happening anyway. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve, at the same time, eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, and people are going back to work. (Applause.) Right? People are going back to work. So\xe2\x80\x94and you know, the fake news always\xe2\x80\x94if I say something that\xe2\x80\x99s like, a little off, next day headline, \xe2\x80\x9cHe misrepresents\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94I have to be careful. But in the history of Presidents, no President\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99m saying no President. Now, maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll find I was off by two but we\xe2\x80\x99re here one year. (Laughter.) No President\xe2\x80\x94well, I read it in lots of good papers, actually. (Laughter.) But they\xe2\x80\x99ll change the story when I say it. No President has ever cut so many regulations in their entire term, okay\xe2\x80\x94(applause)\xe2\x80\x94as we\xe2\x80\x99ve cut in less than a year. (Applause.) And it\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion that the regulations had as big an impact as these massive tax cuts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve given. So I really believe it. (Applause.) We\xe2\x80\x99ve ended the war on American energy. We were in war. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. (Applause.) One of our great natural resources. And very important for our defense\xe2\x80\x94coal\xe2\x80\x94very important for our defense. Because we have it. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to send it through pipes. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get it from foreign countries. We have more than anybody. And they wanted to end it. And our miners have been mistreated and they\xe2\x80\x99re not being mistreated anymore. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing tremendous business. (Applause.) I was in Vietnam, and the Prime Minister and the President of Vietnam were there. And we have a massive deficit with them, like we do with everybody else because these Presidents have just let it go to hell. We have the worst trade deals you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. So we\xe2\x80\x99re changing it. So I said, we have too big of a deficit with Vietnam; I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBuy coal. Buy coal.\xe2\x80\x9d They use a lot of coal. Buy coal. And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, we have bought coal from West Virginia and other places, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the finest coal we have ever used.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. And West Virginia now is doing great. You look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in West Virginia. You look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Pennsylvania. You look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Ohio. (Applause.) And you look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Wyoming. You look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening all over. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s like a different world. And remember this: Virtually, as soon as I got into office, we approved the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota Access pipeline, which would never have been approved. (Applause.) And we announced our withdrawal from the totally disastrous, job-killing, wealth-knocking-out\xe2\x80\x94you know, it knocked out our wealth, or it would have. They basically wanted to take our wealth away. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want us to use our wealth power. We knocked out the Paris Climate Accord. Would have been a disaster. (Applause.) Would have been a disaster for our country. AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: You know, basically, it said, you have a lot of oil and gas that we found\xe2\x80\x94you know, technology has been amazing\xe2\x80\x94and we found things that we never knew. But we have massive\xe2\x80\x94just about the top in the world\xe2\x80\x94we have massive energy reserves. We have coal. We have so much. And basically, they were saying, don\xe2\x80\x99t use it, you can\xe2\x80\x99t use it. So what it does is it makes us uncompetitive with other countries. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen. I told them, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen. And, you know, China, their agreement didn\xe2\x80\x99t kick in until 2030. Right? Our agreement kicks in immediately. Russia, they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to go back into the 1990s, which was not a clean environmental time. Other countries, big countries\xe2\x80\x94India and others\xe2\x80\x94we had to pay, because they considered them a growing country. They were a growing country. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we?\xe2\x80\x9d Are we allowed to grow too? Okay? (Laughter.) Now, are we allowed to grow? (Applause.) They called India a \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping nation.\xe2\x80\x9d They called China a \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping nation.\xe2\x80\x9d But the United States, we\xe2\x80\x99re developed\xe2\x80\x94we can pay. So, folks, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how many people understood the Paris Accord, because it sounds so good. It\xe2\x80\x99s like some of the environmental regulations that I cut\xe2\x80\x94they have the most beautiful titles. And sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cLook, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to close my eyes and sign this because, you know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get killed on this one.\xe2\x80\x9d And I get so much thanks. The country knows what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t build. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t farm. If you had a puddle on your land, they called it a lake for the purposes of environmentals. (Applause.) I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. And I\xe2\x80\x99d sign certain bills and I\xe2\x80\x99d have farmers behind me and I\xe2\x80\x99d have house builders, home builders behind me. And these are tough people, strong people. They fought hard. They\xe2\x80\x99ve worked all their lives, hard. And they\xe2\x80\x99d be\xe2\x80\x94half of them would be crying because we gave them their property back. We gave them the right to earn a living. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. They couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do what they had to do. We gave them their property back. We gave them their dignity back. (Applause.) By the way, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind if I go off script a little bit because, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of boring. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little boring. (Applause.) Got this beautiful speech, everything is wonderful but a little boring. We have to, you know \xe2\x80\x94 But we gave them their dignity back. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why our country is doing record business. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing record business. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing business\xe2\x80\x94and you have to look at the fundamentals. Companies are pouring back into this country. They\xe2\x80\x99re pouring back. Not like \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, when did you hear about car companies coming back into Michigan and coming to Ohio and expanding? (Applause.) When did you hear \xe2\x80\x94 you never heard that. You hear they\xe2\x80\x99re leaving. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about it for 20 years. I was a private sector guy. But for whatever reason, I always had \xe2\x80\x94 these guys always covered me much more than anybody else. I always got a lot of these characters. They used to treat me so good too, until I ran for office. I used to get the greatest publicity. A friend of mine said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, you used to be the king of getting great publicity. What happened?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have some views that they\xe2\x80\x99re opposed to for a lot of bad reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) A lot of really bad reasons. But when you look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to our country, it\xe2\x80\x99s incredible. And the fundamentals are so strong. The stock market \xe2\x80\x94 I just see with all of the ups and downs \xe2\x80\x94 since Election Day, is up 37 percent from Election \xe2\x80\x94 37 percent. (Applause.) Now, it did a little bit of a correction. In fact, I started to say \xe2\x80\x94 you know, I was in it for like 13, 14 months from election. I say, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this sucker ever going down a little bit? This is a little embarrassing.\xe2\x80\x9d It was up 100, up 200, up 1,000, up 150, up 90, up 63. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood, that\xe2\x80\x99s better.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) You know, hey, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got seven years to go, folks. You know, we got a long time to go. (Applause.) So thank you, everybody. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been amazing. You\xe2\x80\x99ve been amazing. You know what Matt didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x94 when I was here in 2011, I made a speech, and I was received with such warmth. And they give \xe2\x80\x94 they used to give \xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Matt does that because he might not want to be controversial, but they used to give \xe2\x80\x9cthe best speech of CPAC.\xe2\x80\x9d Do they do that still, Matt? Because you better pick me or I\xe2\x80\x99m not coming back again. (Laughter.) But \xe2\x80\x94 and I got these \xe2\x80\x94 everybody, they loved that speech. And that was, I think, Matt \xe2\x80\x94 I would say, that might have been the first real political speech that I made. It was a love fest \xe2\x80\x94 2011, I believe the time was \xe2\x80\x94 and a lot of people remembered, and they said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want Trump. We want Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d And after a few years, they go by, and I say, \xe2\x80\x9cHere we are. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what we can do.\xe2\x80\x9d And then everybody said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe cannot get elected. He cannot do it.\xe2\x80\x9d You need 270 votes. You need Electoral College \xe2\x80\x94 which, by the way, is much tougher than the popular vote. The popular vote, actually, would be so much easier. You go three or four states, and you just go and you just do great job. Hillary forgets that. You know, she went to these states. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s she doing? Why does she keep going back to California?\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) Crazy. Next time, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to remember Iowa. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to remember Ohio. (Applause.) Remember? They spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania to no avail. (Applause.) They spent a lot of money. They spent a lot of money in North Carolina, the great state of North Carolina. (Applause.) We did very well there. We have a great person in the room, Mark Meadows, from North Carolina. (Applause.) He\xe2\x80\x99s around here. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Mark? Where\xe2\x80\x99s Mark? And Deb. And we have Jim Jordan. Warriors. Warriors all. (Applause.) We have a lot of great \xe2\x80\x94 we have a lot of great people here. But, you know, we just \xe2\x80\x94 we hit a chord. And if you remember, 2011, probably that was the beginning of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done. And hopefully, at the end of a period of time, people are going to say thank you, because it is not easy. We\xe2\x80\x99re fighting a lot of forces. They\xe2\x80\x99re forces that are doing the wrong thing. They\xe2\x80\x99re just doing the wrong thing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about what they have in mind. But they do the wrong thing. But we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what\xe2\x80\x99s good for our country for the long-term viability and survival. Like, for instance, $700 billion got approved for our military. Our military was going to hell. (Applause.) We declined to certify the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. That was a horrible deal. (Applause.) Whoever heard you give $150 billion to a nation that has no respect for you whatsoever? They\xe2\x80\x99re saying \xe2\x80\x9cDeath to America\xe2\x80\x9d while they\xe2\x80\x99re signing the agreement. If somebody said \xe2\x80\x9cDeath to America\xe2\x80\x9d while I\xe2\x80\x99m signing an agreement, and I\xe2\x80\x99m President, I immediately say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here, folks? I\xe2\x80\x99m not signing.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) What\xe2\x80\x99s going on? They just kept going. Kerry \xe2\x80\x94 Kerry may be the worst negotiator I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. (Laughter.) How about this guy \xe2\x80\x94 how about \xe2\x80\x94 and Obama, of course \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s the one. But how about $1.8 billion in cash? Did you ever see what, like, a million dollars in hundred-dollar bills? A lot of people do it as a promotion. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s big. It\xe2\x80\x99s like big. (Laughter.) Now, take that, go to $1.8 billion in cash. $1.8 billion. For what? For what? Why did we do this? Why did we do it? Anyway, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t certify, and lots of interesting things are happening with that whole mess. But we have to treat \xe2\x80\x94 people that treat us well, we treat them well. People that treat us badly, we treat them much worse than they can ever imagine. That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it has to be. (Applause.) That\xe2\x80\x99s the way it has to be. We officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. (Applause.) You know, every President campaigned on, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d Everybody \xe2\x80\x94 for many Presidents \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading it. And then they never pulled it off. And I now know why. Because I put the word out that I may do it. Right? I said, I\xe2\x80\x99d do it in my campaign, so that usually means \xe2\x80\x94 unless I find something \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it. I was hit by more countries and more pressure and more people calling, begging me, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to do it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do. We have to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d (Applause.) And I did it. But every other President really lied, because they campaigned on it. That was always a big part of the campaign. And then they got into office; they never did it. So I understand why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Because there was tremendous \xe2\x80\x94 the campaign against it was so incredible. But you know what? The campaign for it was also incredible, and we did the right thing. (Applause.) So we\xe2\x80\x99ve kept our promise, as I said, to rebuild our military, eliminating the defense sequester, which is a disaster. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw the number, $700 billion. You know, ultimately, that comes before everything else. We can talk about lots of things. But if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong military, you might not be allowed into this room someday. Okay? You may not have your houses, your homes, your beautiful communities. We better take care of our military. These are the greatest people, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take care of our veterans. (Applause.) We\xe2\x80\x99re going to take care of the vets. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a good job on the vets. And after years of rebuilding other nations \xe2\x80\x94 we rebuild other nations \xe2\x80\x94 we rebuild other nations that have a lot of money, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t ever say, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, you got to help.\xe2\x80\x9d We\xe2\x80\x99re finally rebuilding our nation. We\xe2\x80\x99re rebuilding our nation. (Applause.) And we\xe2\x80\x99re restoring our confidence and our pride. All of us here today are united by the same timeless values. We defend our Constitution, and we believe in the wisdom of our Founders. Our Constitution is great. (Applause.) We support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) True. We know that a strong nation must have strong borders. We celebrate our history and our heroes, and we believe young Americans should be taught to love their country and to respect its traditions. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting the wall. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, okay? I heard some \xe2\x80\x94 (applause) \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re getting the wall. AUDIENCE: Build that wall! Build that wall! Build that wall! THE PRESIDENT: I had a couple of these characters in the back say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, he really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the wall. He just used that for campaigning.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, are you \xe2\x80\x94 can you believe it? (Laughter.) You know, I say, every time I hear that, the wall gets 10 feet higher. You know that, right? (Applause.) Every time. Every single time. Okay? No, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have the wall or they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have what they want. You know, we have a problem: We need more Republicans. We have a group of people that vote against us in a bloc. They\xe2\x80\x99re good at two things: resisting, obstruction. Resisting, obstruction. And they stick together. They do. They always vote in a bloc. You know, it\xe2\x80\x99s very rare that you get a couple of them to come your way. Even on the tax cuts. I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be fighting these people in the \xe2\x80\x9918 election. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be fighting people that voted against the tax cuts, because the tax cuts are phenomenal and popular, and helping people and helping our country. You saw Apple just brought $350 billion in; Exxon brought $50 billion in. (Applause.) So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be fighting. The fact is, we need more Republicans to vote. (Applause.) We want to get our agenda. Because, now, what we have to do is in order to get a vote to fix our military, we have to give them $100 billion in stuff that nobody in this room, including me, wants, in many cases. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible. We need more Republicans. That\xe2\x80\x99s why you have to get out and you have to fight for \xe2\x80\x9918. You have to do it. (Applause.) We salute our great American flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance. (Applause.) And we all proudly stand for the national anthem. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: Above all else, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are at the center of American life. We know that. (Applause.) Because in America, we don\xe2\x80\x99t worship government, we worship God. (Applause.) Our nation\xe2\x80\x99s motto is, \xe2\x80\x9cIn God We Trust.\xe2\x80\x9d (Applause.) And this week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean. Leader. He was a leader. He was a great man. We will never forget the historic crowds, that voice, the energy, and the profound faith of a preacher named Billy Graham. (Applause.) Great man and great family. Franklin Graham. Great family. And they were for us \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, they were for us. Right from the beginning they were for us. As a young man, Billy decided to devote his life to God. That choice not only changed his life, it changed our country. And indeed, it even changed the world. Reverend Graham\xe2\x80\x99s belief in the power of God\xe2\x80\x99s word gave hope to millions and millions who listened to him with his very beautiful, but very simple message: God loves you. (Applause.) And a very special tribute \xe2\x80\x94 because it\xe2\x80\x99s almost never done \xe2\x80\x94 on Wednesday, we will celebrate Billy Graham\xe2\x80\x99s life as he lies in honor in the Rotunda of our Capitol. (Applause.) Very rarely. One day \xe2\x80\x94 Wednesday until Thursday, about 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Wednesday. I bet those lines are going to be long and beautiful, because he deserves it. Not everybody deserves it. But very few people \xe2\x80\x94 you look back, Ronald Reagan was so honored. Very few people are so honored. That\xe2\x80\x99s a big thing. And he really, almost more than anybody you can think of, he deserves to be in the Rotunda. So that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very special. Wednesday at 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock. (Applause.) And Paul, and Mitch, and the whole group, they worked very hard to make it all happen. So we want to thank them too. Everywhere you go, all over the country, in cities small and large, Americans of all faiths reach out to our Creator for strength, for inspiration, and for healing. Great time for healing. In times of grief and hardship, we turn to prayer for solace and for comfort. In recent days, our entire nation has been filled with terrible pain and sorrow over the evil massacre in a great community \xe2\x80\x94 Parkland, Florida. This senseless act of mass murder has shocked our nation and broken our hearts. This week, I had the honor of meeting with students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, with families who have lost their children in prior shootings \xe2\x80\x94 great families, great people \xe2\x80\x94 and with members of the local community right here in Washington, D.C. Our whole nation was moved by their strength and by their courage. We listened to their heart-wrenching stories, asked them for ideas, and pledged to them \xe2\x80\x94 and I can speak for all of the senators and congressmen and congresswomen, all of the people in this room that are involved in this decision \xe2\x80\x94 that we will act. We will do something. We will act. With us on Wednesday was one of the families whose daughter didn\xe2\x80\x99t come home last week \xe2\x80\x94 a beautiful young woman named Meadow Pollack. Incredible family. I had them in the Oval Office. Incredible people. You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen her picture. She had a beautiful, beautiful smile, and a beautiful life. So full of promise. We wish there was something \xe2\x80\x94 anything \xe2\x80\x94 we could do to bring Meadow and all of the others back. There are not enough tears in the world to express our sadness and anguish for her family, and for every family that has lost a precious loved one. No family should ever save \xe2\x80\x94 and ever have to go in and suffer the way these families have suffered. They\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered beyond anything that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever witnessed. A father drops his daughter off at school, kisses her goodbye, waves to her \xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s walking up the path \xe2\x80\x94 and never sees her alive again. Gets a call. Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. Thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a nightmare. Wants to wake up from the nightmare. So we want to hear ideas from Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs about how we can improve security at our schools, tackle the issue of mental health. Because this was a sick person \xe2\x80\x94 very sick \xe2\x80\x94 and we had a lot of warning about him being sick. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a surprise. To the people that knew him, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a little bit; in fact, some said, were surprised it took so long. So what are we doing? What are we doing? We want to ensure that when there are warning signs, we can act and act very quickly. Why do we protect our airports, and our banks, our government buildings, but not our schools? (Applause.) It\xe2\x80\x99s time to make our schools a much harder target for attackers. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want them in our schools. (Applause.) We don\xe2\x80\x99t want them. When we declare our schools to be gun-free zones, it just puts our students in far more danger. (Applause.) Far more danger. Well-trained, gun-adept teachers and coaches and people that work in those buildings; people that were in the Marines for 20 years and retired; people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard; people that are adept \xe2\x80\x94 adept with weaponry and with guns \xe2\x80\x94 they teach. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have 100 guards standing with rifles all over the school. You do a concealed carry permit. (Applause.) And this would be a major deterrent because these people are inherently cowards. If they thought \xe2\x80\x94 like, if this guy thought that other people would be shooting bullets back at him, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone to that school. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone there. It\xe2\x80\x99s a gun-free zone. It says, this is a gun-free zone; please check your guns way far away. And what happens is they feel safe. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody going to come at them. This way, you may have \xe2\x80\x94 and remember, if you use this school as an example \xe2\x80\x94 this is a very big school with tremendous floor area and a lot of acreage. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big, big school. Good school. A big, big school. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to have 150 real guards. Look, you had one guard. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out to be too good, I will tell you that. He turned out to be not good. He was not a credit to law enforcement, that I can tell you. That I can tell you. (Applause.) But as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this idea \xe2\x80\x94 and I feel it\xe2\x80\x99s a great idea, but some people that are good people are opposed to it; they don\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea of teachers doing it. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about teachers. You know, CNN went on, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cDonald Trump wants all teachers.\xe2\x80\x9d Okay? Fake news, folks. Fake news. Fake news. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want a person that\xe2\x80\x99s never handled a gun that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what a gun looks like to be armed. But out of your teaching population \xe2\x80\x94 out of your teaching population, you have 10 percent, 20 percent of very gun-adept people. Military people, law enforcement people, they teach. They teach. (Applause.) And something I thought of this morning. You know what else? And I thought of it since I found and watched Peterson, the deputy who didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the school because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into the school. Okay? He was tested under fire, and that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a good result. But you know what I thought of as soon as I saw that? These teachers \xe2\x80\x94 and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them at a lot of schools where they had problems \xe2\x80\x94 these teachers love their students. And the students love their teachers, in many cases. These teachers love their students. And these teachers are talented with weaponry and with guns. And they feel safe. And I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have somebody that loves their students and wants to protect their students than somebody standing outside that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the students, and, frankly, for whatever reason, decided not to go in even though he heard lots of shots being fired inside. The teachers and the coaches and other people in the building \xe2\x80\x94 the dean, the assistant dean, the principal \xe2\x80\x94 they can \xe2\x80\x94 they love their people. They want to protect these kids. And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re better with that. And this may be 10 percent or 20 percent of the population of teachers, et cetera. It\xe2\x80\x99s not all of them. But you would have a lot, and you would tell people that they\xe2\x80\x99re inside. And the beauty is, it\xe2\x80\x99s concealed. Nobody would ever see it unless they needed it. It\xe2\x80\x99s concealed. So this crazy man who walked in wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even know who it is that has it. That\xe2\x80\x99s good. That\xe2\x80\x99s not bad; that\xe2\x80\x99s good. And a teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened. (Applause.) They love their students. They love those students, folks. Remember that. They love their students. And I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you that would work. Because we need offensive capability. We can\xe2\x80\x99t just say, oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s a gun-free school. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it a little bit better. Because then you say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens outside?\xe2\x80\x9d The students now leave school, and you got a thousand students \xe2\x80\x94 you got 3,500 at the school we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about \xe2\x80\x94 but you have a thousand students standing outside. The teachers are out there also. If a madman comes along, we have the same problem, but it\xe2\x80\x99s outside of the school. Or they drive cars. There are a lot of things that can happen. I want to stop it. And I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a little controversial to say \xe2\x80\x94 but I have to say, since I started this two days ago, a lot of people that were totally opposed to it are now agreeing. They love their students. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want their students to be killed or to be hurt. (Applause.) So we have to do something that works. And one of the big measures that we will do, and everybody in this room I think has to agree \xe2\x80\x94 and there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody that loves the Second Amendment more than I do. And there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody that respects the NRA \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re friends of mine. They backed us all. They\xe2\x80\x99re great people. They\xe2\x80\x99re patriots. (Applause.) But they\xe2\x80\x99re great people. But we really do have to strengthen up, really strengthen up background checks. We have to do that. (Applause.) And we have to do \xe2\x80\x94 for the mentally ill, we have to do very, very \xe2\x80\x94 we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to people that are mentally ill to be having any form of weaponry. We have to be very strong on that. (Applause.) So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that. And I really believe that Congress is going to get it through this time. And they have a different leader. They have somebody that wants to get it through; not somebody that\xe2\x80\x99s just all talk, no action, like so many of these folks. This is somebody that wants to get it through. But I also want to protect \xe2\x80\x94 we need a hardened site. It has to be hardened. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be soft. Because they\xe2\x80\x99ll sneak in through a window, they\xe2\x80\x99ll sneak in some way. And, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re standing there totally unprotected. You know the five great soldiers from four years ago, three of them were world-class marksmen. They were on a military base in a gun-free zone. They were asked to check their guns quite far away. And a maniac walked in, guns blazing, killed all of five of them. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t of had a chance if these world-class marksmen had \xe2\x80\x94 on a military base \xe2\x80\x94 access to their guns. And I\xe2\x80\x99m going to look at that whole policy on military bases. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x94 (applause) \xe2\x80\x94 all five were killed. All five. The guy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had a chance. But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look at that whole military base, gun-free zone. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t have our military holding guns, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty bad. We had a number of instances on military bases. You know that. So we want to protect our military. We want to make our military stronger and better than it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been before. (Applause.) We also need to create a culture in our country that cherishes life and human dignity. That\xe2\x80\x99s part of what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. (Applause.) A culture that condemns violence and never glorifies violence. We need to foster real human connections and turn classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors that want to fight for us. We\xe2\x80\x99re not just having a conversation about school safety. You\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversations \xe2\x80\x94 in all fairness, I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty new on this job. We\xe2\x80\x99re here a little more than a year. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching this stuff go on for 20 years. The President gets up, everybody is enthusiastic for the first couple of days, then it fades, fades, fades. Nothing ever gets done. We want to see if we can get it done. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get it done right. (Applause.) We really owe it to our country. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching for a long time. Seen a lot of words, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen very little action. And, you know, if you think about, most of its just common sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x9cdo you love guns, do hate guns.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s common sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s all common sense. And some of the strongest advocates about what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying are the strongest advocates \xe2\x80\x94 I know them very well \xe2\x80\x94 political people \xe2\x80\x94 the strongest advocates for the Second Amendment. But this is common sense. In addition to securing our schools, we\xe2\x80\x99re also implementing a strategy to secure our streets. We want our kids to be safe everywhere they go, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re in a classroom walking home from school or just outside playing with their friends. (Applause.) Every child deserves to grow up in a safe community surrounded by a loving family and to have a future filled with opportunity and with hope. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Just not fair. Reducing violent crime in America is a top priority for my administration, and we will do whatever it takes to get it done. No talk. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to do what it takes to get it done. (Applause.) As you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, pretty well reported, that we\xe2\x80\x99re significantly increasing gun prosecutions by tremendous percentages, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to get violent offenders off our streets and behind bars, and get them behind bars quickly, for a long time, or get them the hell out of our country. (Applause.) In 2017, we brought cases against more violent offenders than any administration in a quarter of a century \xe2\x80\x94 more than any administration. And we\xe2\x80\x99re just gearing up. We have tough people. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what \xe2\x80\x94 when you deal with MS-13, the only thing they understand is toughness. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything. All they understand is toughness. If that ICE agent or Border Patrol agent is tougher than them, they respect him. We got the toughest guys you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. We got tough. (Applause.) They don\xe2\x80\x99t respect anything else. And they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in our country. They were let in for years. They shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be, and we\xe2\x80\x99re getting them out. Our administration prosecuted more people for federal firearm charges than has been done in more than a decade. And again, we\xe2\x80\x99re just gearing up. We\xe2\x80\x99ve convicted 1,200 gang members and nearly 500 human traffickers. (Applause.) You know what human trafficking \xe2\x80\x94 who would think that we have this in this age? And with our foreign partners, we\xe2\x80\x99ve helped charge or arrest more than 4,000 members of the savage gang that we talked about \xe2\x80\x94 MS-13. Now, they don\xe2\x80\x99t like guns. You know why? They\xe2\x80\x99re not painful enough. These are animals. They cut people. They cut them. They cut them up in little pieces and they want them to suffer. And we take them into our country because our immigration laws are so bad. And when we catch them \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s called catch-and-release \xe2\x80\x94 we have to, by law, catch them and then release them. Catch-and-release. And I can\xe2\x80\x99t get the Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 and nobody has been able to for years \xe2\x80\x94 to approve common-sense measures that, when we catch these animal-killers, we can lock them up and throw away the keys. (Applause.) In 2017, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 100,000 criminal aliens who have committed tens of thousands of crimes. And believe me, these are great people. They cannot \xe2\x80\x94 the laws are just against us. They\xe2\x80\x99re against \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re against safety. They don\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. And you meet with Democrats and they\xe2\x80\x99re always fighting for the criminal. They\xe2\x80\x99re not fighting for law-abiding citizens. They\xe2\x80\x99re always fighting for the criminal. (Applause.) Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. Here are just some of the criminal charges and convictions for the aliens arrested by ICE: 11,000 charges or convictions for sex crimes; 48,000 for assault; 13,000 for burglary; and 1,800 for killing people. We\xe2\x80\x99re cracking down on sanctuary cities. Can you believe this? (Applause.) Where they protect \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s another one. Because we want our cities to be sanctuaries for law-abiding Americans, not for criminals. (Applause.) And, by the way, the Senate Democrats and the House Democrats have totally abandoned DACA. They\xe2\x80\x99ve total \xe2\x80\x94 they don\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to me about it. They have totally abandoned. You know, we get the reputation \xe2\x80\x94 like DACA, it\xe2\x80\x99s not Republican. We\xe2\x80\x99ll let me tell you, it is Republican, because we want to do something about DACA, get it solved after all these years. The Democrats are being totally unresponsive. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything about DACA, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. And it\xe2\x80\x99s very possible that DACA won\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not because of the Republicans, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be because of the Democrats. And frankly, you better elect more Republicans, folks, or it will never happen. (Applause.) The Democrats voted in favor of sanctuary cities. In other words, they voted to protect criminal aliens instead of voting to protect the American citizens. To secure our country, we are calling on Congress to build a great border wall to stop dangerous drugs and criminals from pouring into our country. (Applause.) And now they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to give us the wall, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give us any of the laws to keep these people out. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the wall, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give us all of the other \xe2\x80\x94 chain migration, lottery. Think of a lottery. You have a country. They put names in. You think they\xe2\x80\x99re giving us their good people? Not too many of you people are going to be in a lottery. So we pick out people. Then they turn out to be horrendous, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why. They\xe2\x80\x99re not giving us their best people, folks. They\xe2\x80\x99re not giving us \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, use your heads. They\xe2\x80\x99re giving us \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s a lottery. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people coming into this country with a lottery. I want people coming into this country based on merit. Based on merit. (Applause.) I want people, and we all want to be admitting people, who have skills, who can support themselves financially, who can contribute to our economy, who will love our people, and who will share our values, who will love our country. (Applause.) I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people who drive a car at 100 miles an hour down the West Side Highway and kill 8 innocent victims, and destroy the lives of 14 more. Nobody talks about that. Nobody ever talks about the people that have been so horribly injured, who lose legs and arms, in Manhattan, where I used to spend my time. I know it very well, the stretch along the West Side Highway. People run in order to stay in shape. They want to be healthy, they want to look good. They\xe2\x80\x99re running all the time; I see it. They run. We work in different ways. (Laughter.) But they run. No, but think of this \xe2\x80\x94 they run. And they\xe2\x80\x99re so \xe2\x80\x94 they want to be fit. They\xe2\x80\x99re proud people. They want to be fit, and they\xe2\x80\x99re running up and down West Side Highway. It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful thing. And this maniac takes a car going down the highway, and just turns to a right, and he kills eight. But he really badly wounded 12 to 14 other people. So somebody think of it: Runs to stay in shape, leaves the house, is jogging along, working hard, ends up going home two months later with no leg or with no arm, or with two legs missing. Nobody ever talks about that. They talk about the people, rightfully, that were killed. But they don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the people whose lives have been just changed \xe2\x80\x94 just changed. They don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that. This guy came in through chain migration and a part of the lottery system. AUDIENCE: Booo \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT: They say 22 people came in with him. In other words, an aunt, an uncle, a grandfather, a mother, a father, whoever came in. But a lot of people came in. That\xe2\x80\x99s chain migration. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see how those people are doing, by the way. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to change our way. Merit system. I want merit system. Because you know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening? All of these companies are coming into our country. They\xe2\x80\x99re all coming into our country. And when they come in, we need people that are going to work. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, we need workers now. We need workers. (Applause.) But when I walked in today, did anyone ever hear me do the snake during the campaign? Because I had five people outside say, \xe2\x80\x9cCould you do \xe2\x80\x98The Snake\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d And I said, well, people have heard it. Who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard \xe2\x80\x9cThe Snake\xe2\x80\x9d? You should read it anyways. (Laughs.) Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it anyway. I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. All right? Should we do it? (Applause.) Now, this was a rock-and-roll song \xe2\x80\x94 little amendments \xe2\x80\x94 a rock-and-roll song. But every time I do it, people \xe2\x80\x94 and you have to think of this in terms of immigration. We have to have great people come into our \xe2\x80\x94 I want people to come into our country. And I want people that are going to help us. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people that are going to come in and be accepting all of the gifts of our country for the next 50 years and contribute nothing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want that, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want that. I want people that are going to help and people that are going to work for Chrysler, who is now moving from Mexico into Michigan, and so many other \xe2\x80\x94 and Apple, by the way. (Applause.) And Foxconn up in Wisconsin. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to need 25,000 workers. I want people that can come in, and get to work and work hard. Even if it means a learning period \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. But I want people that are going to come in and work. And I want people that love us and look at security. And they want you to be safe, and they want to be safe. I want great people coming into this country. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people coming in the way they do now, because I want people that contribute. So this is called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Snake.\xe2\x80\x9d And think of it in terms of immigration. And you may love it, or you may say, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that terrible. Okay? And if you say, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that terrible, who cares? Because the way they treat me \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s peanuts compared to the way they treat me. Okay? (Laughter.) Immigration. \xe2\x80\x9cOn her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tenderhearted woman saw a poor, half-hearted, frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. \xe2\x80\x98Poor thing,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you in, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in, for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the vicious snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk, and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night, and soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she\xe2\x80\x99d taken in had been revived. \xe2\x80\x98Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the vicious snake. She clutched him to her bosom, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re so beautiful,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. But if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought you in by now, surely you would have died.\xe2\x80\x99 She stroked his pretty skin again, and kissed and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. \xe2\x80\x98Take me in, oh, tender woman. Take me in for Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Take me in, oh, tender woman,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the vicious snake. \xe2\x80\x98I saved you,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the woman. \xe2\x80\x98And you\xe2\x80\x99ve bitten me. Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s why? You know your bite is poisonous, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to die.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, shut up, silly woman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the reptile with a grin. \xe2\x80\x98You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.'\xe2\x80\x9d (Applause.) And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with our country, folks. We\xe2\x80\x99re letting people in, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot of trouble. It\xe2\x80\x99s only getting worse. But we\xe2\x80\x99re giving you protection like never before. Our law enforcement is doing a better job than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done before. And we love our country. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take care of our country. Okay? We\xe2\x80\x99re going to take care of our country. (Applause.) So just in finishing, our country is starting to do very well. Our economy is blazing. Jobs are at a record level. Jobs are so good. 2.7 million jobs created since the election. (Applause.) Unemployment claims have reached a 45-year low. (Applause.) African American unemployment has reached the lowest level in our history. (Applause.) Hispanic unemployment has reached the lowest level in our history. (Applause.) Women \xe2\x80\x94 women unemployment is at the lowest level in 18 years. (Applause.) Wages are rising for the first time in many, many years. (Applause.) Small business confidence is at a record high. And thanks to our massive tax cuts, millions of Americans are getting to keep a great percentage of their money instead of paying it to a government that throws it out the window. (Applause.) So I just leave you with this: We have to fight Nancy Pelosi. They want to give your money away. They want to give your money away. They want to end your tax cuts. They want to do things that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even believe, including taking your Second Amendment rights away. They will do that. AUDIENCE: Booo \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT: So we have to get out there and we have to fight in \xe2\x80\x9918 like never before \xe2\x80\x94 just the way you fought with us. Just the way you fought with us. You fought so hard, and you were so tough, and you were so smart. You were so smart. And you know what? I know for a fact you did the right thing, because we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the numbers. And the numbers \xe2\x80\x94 even they have to give credit for the kind of numbers that we\xe2\x80\x99re producing. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. (Applause.) Under my administration, the era of economic surrender is over. We\xe2\x80\x99re renegotiating trade deals that are so bad, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s NAFTA or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s World Trade Organization, which created China \xe2\x80\x94 that created \xe2\x80\x94 if you look at China, it was going along like this, then we opened, stupidly, this deal. And China has been like a rocket ship ever since. And now, last year, we had almost a $500 billion trade deficit with China. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have that. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have that. I have great respect for President Xi, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t have that. We have to go, and we have to do what we have to do. We just can\xe2\x80\x99t let countries \xe2\x80\x94 as an example, Mexico. We have a $100 billion trade deficit with Mexico. What does that tell you? You know what it tells you? NAFTA is no good. It never was any good. But for some reason, nobody ever changed it. They emptied our factories \xe2\x80\x94 you got to see the car plants and the auto plants in Mexico. Like \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything like it before. I want those companies \xe2\x80\x94 and they\xe2\x80\x99re starting \xe2\x80\x94 I want them back here. I want them back here. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to come back here, too. (Applause.) And we want to make our neighbors happy. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t continuously have other nations taking advantage of the United States like never before. And this has gone on for a long time. This has gone on for longer \xe2\x80\x94 the last administration was a disaster, but this has gone on for much longer than the last administration. And we got to change it. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to change it. So we\xe2\x80\x99re renegotiating deals. And you know what? Hate to say it, but if we can\xe2\x80\x99t make a fair deal for the United States, we will terminate the deal and we\xe2\x80\x99ll start all over again. (Applause.) We have to do it. (Applause.) So, under my administration, and with your help \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t forget \xe2\x80\x94 you, many of you, were the forgotten people. You were the people that, when the polls came out, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that you existed. The Democrats are trying to figure out who you are, because they want to get you back. But you are people \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ve had people that never voted, but they\xe2\x80\x99re great patriots \xe2\x80\x94 but they never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Then they go to the election, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got Trump-Pence, Trump-Pence. They got hats, they got all sorts of things. Trump over here \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again\xe2\x80\x9d hats. Right? (Applause.) So our country is starting to do well. We are going to make it great, better, safer than it ever was before. The reason is you. This has been a great movement. They try like hell, they cannot stand what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done. But we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the right thing. We\xe2\x80\x99re even doing the right thing for them. They just don\xe2\x80\x99t know it yet. (Applause.) They just don\xe2\x80\x99t know it yet. Even the media \xe2\x80\x94 the media will absolutely support me sometime prior to the election. All those horrible people back there, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to support me. You know why? Because if somebody else won, their ratings would go down, they\xe2\x80\x99d all be out of business. (Applause.) Nobody would watch. They\xe2\x80\x99d all be out of business. So I just want to tell you that we are going to win. I\xe2\x80\x99d love you to get out there, work really hard for \xe2\x80\x9918. We need more Republicans to keep the tax cuts and keep all of this going. And I love you. I respect you. I appreciate everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done for the country. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done. I do want to say, because people have asked \xe2\x80\x94 North Korea \xe2\x80\x94 we imposed today the heaviest sanctions ever imposed on a country before. (Applause.) And frankly, hopefully something positive can happen. We will see. But hopefully something positive can happen. But that just was announced, and I wanted to let you know. We have imposed the heaviest sanctions ever imposed. So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for everything. You have been incredible partners. (Applause.) Incredible partners. And I will let you know in the absolute strongest of terms, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make America great again, and I will never, ever, ever let you down. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. (Applause.)"
