b'THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Paul and Mitch, for the introduction and for your tremendous leadership. You folks have done well. I just looked at some numbers. You\xe2\x80\x99ve even done better than you thought, I think\xe2\x80\x94(laughter)\xe2\x80\x94based on what we just saw about 10 minutes ago. And I want to thank you, to the Governor of this incredible state, my very good friend, Jim Justice and his wonderful wife, Cathy, who are with us. And Jim is now a proud member of the Republican Party. He was a Democrat. He switched over, right? (Applause.) You don\xe2\x80\x99t see that too often. Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll see it more and more. But thank you, Jim. And the hotel is beautiful, and everything is beautiful. We appreciate it. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be among so many friends for the second time this week. Tuesday was an incredible evening, as we were all inspired. (Applause.) And I really mean that. We were inspired by America\xe2\x80\x99s heroes and uplifted by everyone who has sacrificed in the fight for freedom. They were, and are, incredible people that we saw that night, and tremendous courage. And one of the people, I have to say\xe2\x80\x94boy, you got a very big hand, Steve. Steve Scalise. A great hand. (Applause.) And we\xe2\x80\x99re all truly blessed to be Americans. Before going any further, I want to send our prayers to everyone affected by the train accident yesterday, and especially to the family of the person who was so tragically killed. Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones. And thank you. With us today on stage is our incredible leadership team. And they really have\xe2\x80\x94if you look\xe2\x80\x94you just look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the last short period of time. Without them, I could have never won the Presidency, I guess. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, could I have won the Presidency without them? (Laughter.) Huh? Steve, yes, right? (Laughter.) I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. But they\xe2\x80\x99ve become very good friends, and we\xe2\x80\x99re now in battle together and in friendship together. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (Applause.) Thank you, Mitch. Great guy. (Applause.) That was a big win we had, Mitch. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. John, thank you. Great job. (Applause.) House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Again, Steve, thank you. (Applause.) House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin. (Applause.) Chair John Thune and House Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers. (Applause.) Did they forget your name, John? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What\xe2\x80\x99s going on here? (Laughter.) John Cornyn, everybody knows. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t put his name up, but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. That\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that\xe2\x80\x99s ever happened. Hey, John, that will never happen again. (Laughter.) Working together, we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished extraordinary things for the American people over the last year, and I really believe this is just the beginning. You know, Paul Ryan called me the other day, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99m supposed to say this, but I will say that he said to me, he has never, ever seen the Republican Party so united, so much in like with each other. But, literally, the word \xe2\x80\x9cunited\xe2\x80\x9d was the word he used. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most united he\xe2\x80\x99s ever seen the party, and I see it too. I have so many friends in this group, and there is a great coming together that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either party has seen for many, many years. So\xe2\x80\x94right? SPEAKER RYAN: Yep. THE PRESIDENT: That\xe2\x80\x99s good. (Applause.) I was hoping he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t deny that. (Laughter.) But he did\xe2\x80\x94he called me, and I thought it was very nice. So thank you, Paul, very much. Every day, we\xe2\x80\x99re removing government burdens and empowering our citizens to follow their hearts and live out their dreams. The priorities of Republicans in Congress are the priorities of the American people. We believe in strong families, and we believe in strong borders. (Applause.) We believe in the rule of law, and we support the men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) We believe every American has the right to grow up in a safe home and attend a good school and to have access to a really great job. And we know that, for Americans, nothing\xe2\x80\x94absolutely nothing\xe2\x80\x94is out of reach because we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cquit.\xe2\x80\x9d We don\xe2\x80\x99t quit. And the Republican Party certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quit\xe2\x80\x94because if we did, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here today. We\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting home saying, \xe2\x80\x9cBoy, that was a tough year,\xe2\x80\x9d instead of, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was one of the greatest years in the history of politics, in the history of our country for a party\xe2\x80\x94what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished.\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s been done, and certainly not by much. We had a year that was almost, I would think, unlike any. It was a tremendous success, and I give everybody in this room the credit. And I give, certainly, these people behind me tremendous credit for what took place, especially in that last month. That was a month of tremendous pressure, and that was people that were able to act under pressure. My favorite type of person. They were able to act under tremendous pressure. So I just want to thank you all, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was all about. And, you know, it was interesting\xe2\x80\x94while we had a great year, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t being given credit for it\xe2\x80\x94regulations at a level that nobody has ever done. In one year, we knocked out more regulations than anybody. Supreme Court justice, judges, all over. So many different records. So many successes. But when we got the great tax cut bill\xe2\x80\x94and we call it the Tax Cut and Jobs Bill\xe2\x80\x94we got that, it was like putting it all in a box and wrapping it with a beautiful ribbon. We started getting credit not only for that, but for all of the other things that we did during the year. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing the way that happened. I was surprised, actually. But we got a lot of credit from a lot of people. And all of a sudden, they\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we had a lot of accomplishment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and then they went on to do the thing. But the fact is\xe2\x80\x94(laughter)\xe2\x80\x94you understand that. But we really did. We got a lot of credit. It all came together in that final month. And so I give everybody in this room, really, kudos. We\xe2\x80\x99re a nation of builders and dreamers and strivers and fighters. And together, we\xe2\x80\x99re building a safe, strong, and very proud America, already, since the election. We\xe2\x80\x99ve created 2.4 million jobs. That\xe2\x80\x99s unthinkable. (Applause.) And that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include all of the things that are happening. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to see numbers that get even better. The stock market has added more than $8 trillion in new wealth. Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, which is something. After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. African American and Hispanic unemployment have both reached the lowest levels ever recorded. That\xe2\x80\x99s something very, very special. (Applause.) And when I made that statement the other night, there was zero movement from the Democrats. They sat there, stone cold, no smile, no applause. You would have thought that, on that one, they would have, sort of, at least clapped a little bit. Which tells you, perhaps, they\xe2\x80\x99d rather see us not do well than see our country do great. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not good. That\xe2\x80\x99s not good. We have to change that. (Applause.) And as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99ve eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration has ever eliminated. And that means four years, eight years, or, in one instance, sixteen years. In one year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve knocked out more regulations. It\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing thing. And I happen to think that that is every bit as important toward our success as the tax cuts. I have many business friends and many people in business that came to me and they say that\xe2\x80\x94including small businesses\xe2\x80\x94they say the fact that they no longer have to go through years of turmoil in getting approved and getting approvals, and getting rule changes and getting all sorts of things, and getting old while they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to get them\xe2\x80\x94the fact that all of that is gone is probably as important or even more important to the massive tax cuts we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten people. So that\xe2\x80\x99s something. We\xe2\x80\x99ve signed into law the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. And I have to say, included in there is the individual mandate. We repealed it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a big one. (Applause.) That\xe2\x80\x99s so big. By itself, that would be a big achievement. And we, sort of, take it as, well, that was included. And ANWR, one of the great potential fields anywhere in the world. (Applause.) And I never appreciated ANWR so much. A friend of mine called up, who\xe2\x80\x99s in that world and in that business, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it true that you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about ANWR?\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get it, but you know.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you kidding? That\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest thing, by itself.\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cRonald Reagan and every President has wanted to get ANWR approved.\xe2\x80\x9d And after that, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, make sure that\xe2\x80\x99s in the bill.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) It was amazing how that had an impact. That had a very big impact on me, Paul. I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about it, and then when I heard that everybody wanted it\xe2\x80\x94for 40 years, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to get it approved, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cMake sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t lose ANWR.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) But it\xe2\x80\x99s great for the people of Alaska. And Senator Sullivan and Senator Murkowski are here someplace. Where are they? But they are very happy campers. Senator? (Applause.) Good, Senator. Thank you. They worked very\xe2\x80\x94 LEADER RYAN: And Don Young. THE PRESIDENT: Where\xe2\x80\x99s Don Young? He\xe2\x80\x99s such a quiet guy. Where Is Don? (Laughter.) Don Young, also. Don, thank you. AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) all along. THE PRESIDENT: So\xe2\x80\x94no, we were always going to get it. We never had a problem with it. But if you think about, that by itself is a big bill. The individual mandate by itself is a big, powerful bill. That was just added on to what we did with the massive tax cuts. I want to thank Senate Finance Chairman\xe2\x80\x94and a very spectacular man\xe2\x80\x94Orrin Hatch. (Applause.) Where\xe2\x80\x99s Orrin? Orrin. Orrin is\xe2\x80\x94I love listening to him speak. He said once, I am the single greatest President in his lifetime. Now, he\xe2\x80\x99s a young man, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not that much, but\xe2\x80\x94(laughter). And he actually once said I\xe2\x80\x99m the greatest President in the history of our country. And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes that include Lincoln and Washington?\xe2\x80\x9d He said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI love this guy.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) I love him. But he is, he\xe2\x80\x99s a special guy. And House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady for their incredible work. (Applause.) Kevin? Where are you, Kevin? That\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94what a job. I\xe2\x80\x99d call Kevin night after night. \xe2\x80\x9cKevin, what about this? What about that?\xe2\x80\x9d You were always there. He was working. What did you average sleep for about four weeks? About\xe2\x80\x94maybe nothing? I think he had no average. But you did a great job. Nobody knows it better than you, Kevin. Thank you. Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll do a phase two, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do a phase two. Are you ready for that, Kevin? Huh? I think you\xe2\x80\x99re ready. (Laughter.) We\xe2\x80\x99ll get them even lower. But we are proud of you. Here in West Virginia, as a result of our tax cuts, the typical family of four will save roughly $2,000 a year. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. And when I came into this beautiful building just a little while ago, one of the people said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I just got a check, and I have $221 more than I had last year at this time in my envelope.\xe2\x80\x9d (Applause.) And that one\xe2\x80\x94really, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we were waiting. We were waiting for February, and then we got hit with these corporations giving tremendous bonuses to everybody that Nancy Pelosi called \xe2\x80\x9ccrumbs.\xe2\x80\x9d That was a bad\xe2\x80\x94that could be like \xe2\x80\x9cdeplorable.\xe2\x80\x9d Does that make sense? \xe2\x80\x9cDeplorable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccrumbs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94those two words, they seem to have a resemblance. I hope it has the same meaning. But she called it crumbs, when people are getting $2,000 and $3,000 and $1,000. That\xe2\x80\x99s not crumbs. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money. We also doubled the child tax credit, and that\xe2\x80\x99s so helpful to so many. We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from one of the highest business tax rates anywhere in the world, to one of the most competitive\xe2\x80\x94one of the lower ones\xe2\x80\x94so that our great workers and companies can compete and win against anyone. We\xe2\x80\x99ve now given them the tools to go out and win. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. And they\xe2\x80\x99re also pouring back. A lot of you folks, you saw Davos the other day, they\xe2\x80\x99re coming back. I believe I brought hundreds of billions of dollars with me back from Europe, back from Switzerland, when I went there the other day to make a speech. They\xe2\x80\x99re so excited about this country and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here. And they would never, ever have come. In fact, if the opposing party had won the election, you would have had tremendous new rules and regulations put on everything, and other things would have happened. And instead of going up almost 50 percent, your stock market, in my opinion, would have gone down 50 percent\xe2\x80\x94I really believe that\xe2\x80\x94because they were stifling it. They were getting prepared to stifle even worse than it was. The changes to our business tax alone are expected to raise average household income by $4,000. Roughly 3 million workers have already received tax cut bonuses and raises totaling thousands and thousands of dollars per worker\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s just over the past six weeks alone. Because of our tax cuts, Apple is investing $350 billion in the United States. They\xe2\x80\x99re bringing $240 billion back\xe2\x80\x94$240 billion. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay a tax of $38 billion, Mitch\xe2\x80\x94$38 billion. But they\xe2\x80\x99re going to invest a total of $350 billion. And when I first heard the number, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean billion, you mean $350 million.\xe2\x80\x9d Because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying to Tim Cook, \xe2\x80\x9cTim, we got to build plants here.\xe2\x80\x9d You know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to build a lot of plants. And this would have never happened without us and the work you\xe2\x80\x99ve done. And they\xe2\x80\x99re hiring 20,000 workers, by the way. (Applause.) And two days ago, ExxonMobil, in addition to many others, just announced that they are investing $50 billion in the United States. So the good news just keeps on rolling in, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to. And I want to thank Senator Tim Scott for \xe2\x80\x9copportunity zones.\xe2\x80\x9d Our tax plan encourages this investment. Where is Tim? What a good guy Tim is. (Applause.) Tim. See him over there someplace? Thank you, Tim. But we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in distressed communities to create more jobs for those who have too often been left behind. And Tim worked hard on that. We want every American to know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck, and the satisfaction of a job really well done. And we\xe2\x80\x99re reaching our hand all across the aisle in pursuit of common ground and commonsense reforms for the good of all Americans. All Americans. We can reform our prison system to help those who have served their time get a second chance at life. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched this, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve studied it. And people get out of prison, and they made a mistake. And not all\xe2\x80\x94some are very bad, but many are very good. And they come home and they can\xe2\x80\x99t get a job. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad. They can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94they can\xe2\x80\x99t get a job. Now, the best thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to fix that, Paul, is the fact that the economy is just booming. I mean, that fixes it better than any program we can do, anything we can do at all. But the economy is so strong now and so good, and so many companies are moving in that I really believe that problem\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s a big problem\xe2\x80\x94is going to solve itself. But we\xe2\x80\x99re working on it. We can invest in workforce development, job training, and open new vocational schools, because we want every American to be able to reach their full God-given potential. Vocational schools\xe2\x80\x94today you have community colleges and you have all of the\xe2\x80\x94when I was growing up, we had vocational schools. And when I was going to school, I remember I was in high school, and there were people in class\xe2\x80\x94one person in particular, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, like, the greatest student. And\xe2\x80\x94he just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. And yet, I saw him one day, and he was able to fix a car engine, blindfolded. And everybody else was saying that\xe2\x80\x99s amazing how talented he is. He had a different kind of a talent. And we should have vocational schools. You learn mechanical, you learn bricklaying and carpentry, and all of these things. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have that very much anymore. And I think the word \xe2\x80\x9cvocational\xe2\x80\x9d is a much better word than, in many cases, a community college. A lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t know what a community college means or represents. So we\xe2\x80\x99re working very hard on vocational schools so that when all these companies move into this country, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a workforce that knows exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. In addition to that, when they move in, we\xe2\x80\x99re giving them incentives to also train people themselves. Because, in many ways, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to do it. In Wisconsin, we have a great company moving in. They make all of the Apple iPhones, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a big program. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a tremendous program to teach people how to do this, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a whole new skill. And it will be very successful. We can reduce the price of prescription drugs and ensure that terminally ill patients have a right to try. (Applause.) So important\xe2\x80\x94right to try. You know, those drugs, they sit in there for 12, 13, 14 years. And a person is terminally ill, they have two months left, and under the old system they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give them even an experimental medicine because they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be hurt. Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be around for two months. So they\xe2\x80\x99ll sign a waiver, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to give them the hope of finding something. You have people\xe2\x80\x94and I\xe2\x80\x99ve known people like this\xe2\x80\x94they travel all over the world to try and find a cure. And we have great experimental drugs, but it will be years before they come on to the market. So it\xe2\x80\x99s called Right to Try, and I hope you folks can approve it, and I hope you agree with it. But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s so important. It\xe2\x80\x99s so important. (Applause.) And Scott Gottlieb is heading it up. And it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and the other thing you get is you learn pretty quickly how effective it is; does it work. But you learn it really, very quickly. So, Right to Try. We can fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones that are fair. And the most important word to me, on trade, is \xe2\x80\x9creciprocal.\xe2\x80\x9d Because we have deals where companies will send in a motorbike, and we charge them nothing. But when we send a Harley-Davidson or a motorbike to those countries, they charge us 100 percent tax. That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. So they\xe2\x80\x99ll send their motorbikes, or something, into us\xe2\x80\x94zero. We send it to them\xe2\x80\x94100 percent. That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair trade. That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair. So I like the word \xe2\x80\x9creciprocal.\xe2\x80\x9d If they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it to us, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it to them. And what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen is your numbers are going to either come down, or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a lot of money. And either one is okay, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned. We can rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and we will; streamline the horrible approval process\xe2\x80\x94roadways that take 12, 13, 14 years to get approved. We used to build them in three months, and now it takes years and years of approvals. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring that down, ideally, to one year. Two years is our goal, but one year is our real goal. And we can get it done under budget, and we want to get it done ahead of schedule. Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t have too many of them. Under budget and ahead of schedule. We can deliver for our police, our veterans, and our brave servicemembers. And finally, after decades of waiting, we can finally pass immigration reform that protects our country, defends our borders, and modernizes our immigration rules to serve the needs of American workers and of American families. So important. One of the strengths of the Republican Party is that we\xe2\x80\x99re a big tent with many diverse views, but the one thing we can all agree on\xe2\x80\x94and that\xe2\x80\x99s that, in every decision, we make our highest priority to serve and to protect the American people. We want an immigration policy that\xe2\x80\x99s fair, equitable, but that\xe2\x80\x99s going to protect our people. We want people coming into our country based on merit and based on the fact that they are going to love our country, and they respect our people and our country. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want visa lottery. Pick a lottery ticket. Pick a lottery. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want that. So we want it based on merit. (Applause.) We have a chance now to pass into law the immigration reforms that the American people have been demanding for decades and that many of you have been working on for your entire careers. We have a great opportunity as a Republican Party. As the Republican Party, we have a great opportunity. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting very little help from the Democrats, but I hope after I leave this room, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a call from these people saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xe2\x80\x9d You know, they talk a good game. We have to get help from the other side, or we have to elect many more Republicans. That\xe2\x80\x99s another way of doing it. (Applause.) Really, that\xe2\x80\x99s another way of doing it. And based on the numbers we just saw, we have a real chance of doing that. You know, \xe2\x80\x9918 is going to be very interesting. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do one or the other. Either they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to come on board\xe2\x80\x94because they talk a good game with DACA, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t produce. And so either they come on board, or we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to really work and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to get more people so we can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass, in a much easier fashion, legislation. And to get it done, we\xe2\x80\x99ll all have to make some compromises along the way\xe2\x80\x94to get it done this way. Now, to get it done the other way, if we win more, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to compromise so much. Okay? With the tax bill, we got what we wanted because we had, essentially, a unanimous vote. But we have to go, and we have to get it done and get it done properly, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to compromise\xe2\x80\x94unless we elect more Republicans, in which case, we can have it just the way everybody in this room wants it. We have to be willing to give a little in order for our country to gain a whole lot. If we\xe2\x80\x99re united, if we work together for the good of the nation, and we can fulfill our sacred duty to the country and to our incredible voters, we have really fulfilled a solemn promise. As you know, I have put forward an immigration framework based on many months of meeting and working with Tom Cotton, and working with John Cornyn, who was in the office the other day, and David Perdue\xe2\x80\x94incredible people\xe2\x80\x94and Bob Goodlatte, who\xe2\x80\x99s out here someplace. Really incredible people. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a strong bill, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a very fair bill. And it protects our border. We have to protect our borders. (Applause.) It includes reforms that are overwhelmingly popular with the voters, including Democrats. The Democrats want to have\xe2\x80\x94the real Democrats, they want to have their borders protected. But it includes Democrats, independents, Republicans. Americans want an immigration system that works for everybody. And they want safety. And, by the way, they also want a strong military. And we have to be very powerful on our military. You know, our military has been depleted over the last long period of time, even beyond Obama. It\xe2\x80\x99s been depleted. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to build up. This should not be a party thing; this should be common sense. Without our military, we might not be here talking. We have to have a strong military. And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re very much on our way. From the one standpoint, we\xe2\x80\x99re going for funding, which we need, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it. But we have a lot of fighting on that from the other side, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t even think about it. We need a strong and powerful military. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have far more powerful than we were ever before. (Applause.) Nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes a permanent solution on DACA. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing about DACA for so many years. Some people call it DREAMers. It\xe2\x80\x99s not DREAMers. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fall into that trap. It\xe2\x80\x99s just much different than DREAMers. And I said the other night, you know, we have dreamers too. We have dreamers in this country, too. You can\xe2\x80\x99t forget our dreamers. I have a lot of dreamers here. (Applause.) But DACA\xe2\x80\x94we want to take care of DACA, and I hope we will. We need the support of the Democrats in order to do it, and they might not want to do it. They talk like they do, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they do. But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find out very soon. We want something that is very, very tough and strong, in terms of the border. We need to end chain migration, and we need to cancel the terrible visa lottery. (Applause.) And those are the four pillars that I talked about the other night. We call them the White House framework\xe2\x80\x94a plan that will finally bring our immigration system into the 21st Century. The Republican position on immigration is the center, mainstream view of the American people, with some extra strength at the border and security at the border added in. What we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for and what the American people are pleading for is sanity and common sense in our immigration system. We want immigration rules that protect our communities, defend our security, and admit people who will love our country and contribute to our society. I know that the Senate is planning to bring an immigration bill on the floor, to the floor, in coming weeks. And I\xe2\x80\x99m asking that the framework we submitted\xe2\x80\x94with great flexibility, great flexibility, working with both parties\xe2\x80\x94that something very positive will come out of it for our country, for everybody\xe2\x80\x94for our country. And I think that can happen. If the Democrats choose to filibuster a framework that includes a generous path to citizenship or something that is not fair, we are not going to approve it. We\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to approve it. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll either have something that\xe2\x80\x99s fair and equitable and good and secure, or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have nothing at all. And this has been going on for many years. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense, however, to have nothing at all, because this is something that people want. So we will be demonstrating that we are very, very serious. One of the reasons I gave a number that was, I thought, a very generous number was because I wanted to see whether or not they were interested in approving that. Because if they don\xe2\x80\x99t approve something within that sphere, that means, very simply, that they\xe2\x80\x99re not looking to approve it at all. They want to use it for an election issue, but it\xe2\x80\x99s now an election issue that will go to our benefit, not their benefit. (Applause.) But make no mistake: I will not rest until we have delivered for the citizens of our great country so many different things\xe2\x80\x94immigration, the strong military. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done an awfully good job of protecting our Second Amendment. That was in question during the campaign, you remember, and we have done a very, very good job. (Applause.) For the last 12 months, I have kept one promise after another, and we\xe2\x80\x99re just getting started. So often I\xe2\x80\x99ll see\xe2\x80\x94and I must say, six, seven months ago, they were saying, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill his promise on this or that. I said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve only been here for four months. You know, other people were there for eight years and they would finally get something passed. I was there four months\xe2\x80\x94you know this, Paul\xe2\x80\x94and they were saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill a promise.\xe2\x80\x9d But now we\xe2\x80\x99ve fulfilled far more promises than we promised. (Laughter.) And they\xe2\x80\x99re having a hard time with that. We have seriously fulfilled promises. I call it \xe2\x80\x9cpromises plus.\xe2\x80\x9d (Laughter.) And one of the things we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that\xe2\x80\x99s so important\xe2\x80\x94and Mitch has worked so hard on, and Don, and everybody\xe2\x80\x94is the justices, the judges all over the country. We\xe2\x80\x99re filling up the courts with really talented people who understand and read the Constitution for what it says. (Applause.) So it\xe2\x80\x99s really not talked about that much, but it is a tremendous impact. It\xe2\x80\x99s having already a tremendous impact. And we have incredible people lined up\xe2\x80\x94just lined up\xe2\x80\x94that are getting ready to go into the courts. And, in many ways, Mitch, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be one of the most important things, if not the most important thing, that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing. Defense is always the most. Got to be the most, John, right? But what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with the courts, I think, is going to go down as one of the greatest achievements, so I want to thank you for that. Thank you. (Applause.) And not only are we protecting America at home, we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting our interests abroad. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to finally end the dangerous defense sequester. It would be wonderful if we could go back to a budget\xe2\x80\x94(applause)\xe2\x80\x94in order to fully fund our military, and do it properly and order properly, and have it over a period of time, and do it the right way. So at some point, I hope, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to do that and it should work. And in order to defeat terrorists, we\xe2\x80\x99re also asking Congress to ensure that we continue to have all necessary power and everything we need to defeat and detain the terrorists. We can\xe2\x80\x99t treat terrorists like common criminals; they are really unlawful enemy combatants. (Applause.) When you see what they do and the way they do it, and the level of ferocity, we can\xe2\x80\x99t treat them the way we do the ordinary criminal. And as you saw on Tuesday, I\xe2\x80\x99ve signed an order keeping open our very secure detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.) It\xe2\x80\x99s another promise kept. And there is one more very important promise we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping: No longer are we making apologies for America. We don\xe2\x80\x99t apologize anymore. (Applause.) We\xe2\x80\x99re proud of our history, we\xe2\x80\x99re confident in our values, and we\xe2\x80\x99re grateful to our heroes, and we are determined to create a brighter future for all of our people. We are restoring the bonds of love and loyalty that unite us all, as friends, as neighbors, as citizens, as Americans. Because when Americans are united, nothing\xe2\x80\x94nothing at all\xe2\x80\x94nothing can stop us. We win. (Applause.) As I said the other night, we are a nation that built the Empire State Building in one year. Actually, to be exact, it was\xe2\x80\x94we built it in less than a year. Would you believe it? Working 24 hours around the clock. We built the Hoover Dam in record time. We built the Golden Gate Bridge. We linked our nation together with railroads and highways. We dug out the Panama Canal. We\xe2\x80\x99re the nation that won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and put satellites into space and planted our great American flag on the face of the moon. We\xe2\x80\x99ve healed the sick, cured disease, and cared for the poor like no other nation. We\xe2\x80\x99ve lifted millions into prosperity, and delivered millions into freedom. This is our legacy. This is our birthright. And this is the foundation on which we build our very glorious future. Because together, we are, indeed, making America great again. Thank you, and God bless you all. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you.'
