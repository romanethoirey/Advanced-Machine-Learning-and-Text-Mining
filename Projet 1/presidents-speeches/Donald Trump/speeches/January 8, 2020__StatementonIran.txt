b'As long as I am President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Good morning.\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased to inform you: The American people should be extremely grateful and happy no Americans were harmed in last night\xe2\x80\x99s attack by the Iranian regime.\xc2\xa0We suffered no casualties, all of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything.\xc2\xa0Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.\xc2\xa0I salute the incredible skill and courage of America\xe2\x80\x99s men and women in uniform. For far too long \xe2\x80\x94 all the way back to 1979, to be exact \xe2\x80\x94 nations have tolerated Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond.\xc2\xa0Those days are over.\xc2\xa0Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world.\xc2\xa0We will never let that happen. Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives.\xc2\xa0At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world\xe2\x80\x99s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.\xc2\xa0As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities. He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets.\xc2\xa0He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region.\xc2\xa0He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims. Soleimani directed the recent attacks on US\xc2\xa0personnel in Iraq that badly wounded four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the US\xc2\xa0embassy in Baghdad.\xc2\xa0In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him. Soleimani\xe2\x80\x99s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood.\xc2\xa0He should have been terminated long ago.\xc2\xa0By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists: If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime.\xc2\xa0These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior. In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two US\xc2\xa0drones. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash.\xc2\xa0Instead of saying \xe2\x80\x9cthank you\xe2\x80\x9d to the United States, they chanted \xe2\x80\x9cdeath to America.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0In fact, they chanted \xe2\x80\x9cdeath to America\xe2\x80\x9d the day the agreement was signed. Then, Iran went on a terror spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq.\xc2\xa0The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration.\xc2\xa0The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing 1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran. The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.\xc2\xa0Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism.\xc2\xa0The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal -\xe2\x80\x93 or JCPOA \xe2\x80\x93- and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place.\xc2\xa0We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper, and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential.\xc2\xa0Iran can be a great country. Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred, and war.\xc2\xa0The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime: Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer.\xc2\xa0It will not be allowed to go forward. Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process.\xc2\xa0Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before and America has achieved energy independence.\xc2\xa0These historic\xc2\xa0accomplishments\xc2\xa0changed our strategic priorities.\xc2\xa0These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible.\xc2\xa0And options in the Middle East became available.\xc2\xa0We are now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world.\xc2\xa0We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil. The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration, at a cost of $2.5 trillion.\xc2\xa0US\xc2\xa0Armed Forces are stronger than ever before.\xc2\xa0Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast.\xc2\xa0Under construction are many hypersonic missiles. The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it.\xc2\xa0We do not want to use it.\xc2\xa0American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent. Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way.\xc2\xa0He was a monster.\xc2\xa0Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate, and failed. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration.\xc2\xa0ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran\xc2\xa0 The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities. Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran: We want you to have a future and a great future \xe2\x80\x94 one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world.\xc2\xa0The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. I want to thank you, and God bless America.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.'
