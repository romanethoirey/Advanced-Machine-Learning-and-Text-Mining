b'THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Before we begin, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a negotiation going on for about two days.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going extremely well.\xc2\xa0 Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot.\xc2\xa0 Very good relationship that we have.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal. We\xe2\x80\x99re covering everything \xe2\x80\x94 all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done, whether it was theft or anything.\xc2\xa0 Anything.\xc2\xa0 The unfairness.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people think it\xe2\x80\x99s $506 billion.\xc2\xa0 Some people think it\xe2\x80\x99s much more than that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be leveling the playing field. The tariffs are hurting China very badly.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want them.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, if we can make the deal, it\xe2\x80\x99d be my honor to remove them.\xc2\xa0 But otherwise, we\xe2\x80\x99re having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve never had that before with China.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been very much of a one-way street. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t respected us for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Not for a long time. The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we\xe2\x80\x99re agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement. \xc2\xa0You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems.\xc2\xa0 But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that\xe2\x80\x99s just been strengthened further. So with the UK, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by.\xc2\xa0 We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States.\xc2\xa0 The relationship there, also, is very good. We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.\xc2\xa0 And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 And many other things.\xc2\xa0 A lot of positive things are going on. We\xe2\x80\x99re working on a summit.\xc2\xa0 And you know all about the summit.\xc2\xa0 It will be in Vietnam \xe2\x80\x94 Hanoi.\xc2\xa0 And we will \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting in Hanoi.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting in Hanoi.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect.\xc2\xa0 And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.\xc2\xa0 A lot was done in the first summit.\xc2\xa0 No more rockets going up.\xc2\xa0 No more missiles going up.\xc2\xa0 No more testing of nuclear.\xc2\xa0 Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War.\xc2\xa0 And we got back our hostages. But we hope we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be very much equally as successful.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m in no rush for speed.\xc2\xa0 We just don\xe2\x80\x99t want testing.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions, as you know, remain.\xc2\xa0 Everything is remaining.\xc2\xa0 China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us.\xc2\xa0 And South Korea, I think you can say, has been \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan. But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be doing.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s okay \xe2\x80\x94 as per the United Nations. So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one.\xc2\xa0 I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.\xc2\xa0 We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States.\xc2\xa0 They have really taken advantage of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Billions of dollars has been paid to them.\xc2\xa0 And we won\xe2\x80\x99t let that happen. But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power.\xc2\xa0 Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China \xe2\x80\x94 right smack in the middle \xe2\x80\x94 is phenomenal. And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.\xc2\xa0 So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home.\xc2\xa0 We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t control our own border. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it one way or the other \xe2\x80\x94 we have to do it \xe2\x80\x94 not because it was a campaign promise, which it is.\xc2\xa0 It was one of many, by the way; not my only one.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before. You look at other economies \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re doing terribly, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing phenomenally.\xc2\xa0 The market is up tremendously today, not that that\xe2\x80\x99s anything, but, you know \xe2\x80\x94 because I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back in and they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, the market just went down.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.\xc2\xa0 We have all the records.\xc2\xa0 We have every record.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re getting close to that point again where we\xe2\x80\x99ll create new records. So our country is doing very well, economically.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot.\xc2\xa0 But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border.\xc2\xa0 When you look and when you listen to politicians \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, certain Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 they say it all comes through the port of entry.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a lie.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all a lie. They say walls don\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 Walls work 100 percent.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s El Paso \xe2\x80\x94 I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso \xe2\x80\x94 we had a tremendous crowd, and \xe2\x80\x94 tremendous crowd.\xc2\xa0 And I asked the people \xe2\x80\x94 many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas.\xc2\xa0 And I asked them.\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You were there, some of you.\xc2\xa0 It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.\xc2\xa0 You know what they did. But that\xe2\x80\x99s only one example.\xc2\xa0 There are so many examples.\xc2\xa0 In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall.\xc2\xa0 And they had 23 murders.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of murders, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico. So everyone knows that walls work.\xc2\xa0 And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly.\xc2\xa0 You just take a look.\xc2\xa0 Almost everywhere.\xc2\xa0 Take a look at Israel.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re building another wall.\xc2\xa0 Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me \xe2\x80\x94 99.9 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what it would be with us, too. The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.\xc2\xa0 They go around the wall and in.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what it is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple.\xc2\xa0 And a big majority of the big drugs \xe2\x80\x94 the big drug loads \xe2\x80\x94 don\xe2\x80\x99t go through ports of entry.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t go through ports of entry.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t take big loads because you have people \xe2\x80\x94 we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement \xe2\x80\x94 looking. You can\xe2\x80\x99t take human traffic \xe2\x80\x94 women and girls \xe2\x80\x94 you can\xe2\x80\x99t take them through ports of entry.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.\xc2\xa0 They open the door.\xc2\xa0 They look.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied. They go through areas where you have no wall.\xc2\xa0 Everybody knows that.\xc2\xa0 Nancy knows it.\xc2\xa0 Chuck knows it.\xc2\xa0 They all know it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all a big lie.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a big con game. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there\xe2\x80\x99s no barrier, and they come into the United States.\xc2\xa0 Welcome. We\xe2\x80\x99ve detained more people.\xc2\xa0 Our border agents are doing such incredible work.\xc2\xa0 Our military has been incredible.\xc2\xa0 We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.\xc2\xa0 We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very successful. But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very necessary.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve broken up two caravans that are on their way.\xc2\xa0 They just are breaking.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of breaking up.\xc2\xa0 We have another one that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to break up yet. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank the President.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank Mexico.\xc2\xa0 They have their own problems.\xc2\xa0 They have the largest number of murders that they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had in their history \xe2\x80\x94 almost 40,000 murders.\xc2\xa0 Forty thousand.\xc2\xa0 And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will. But I just want to thank the President, because he\xe2\x80\x99s been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up.\xc2\xa0 We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s largely broken up.\xc2\xa0 Others have gotten through.\xc2\xa0 And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there.\xc2\xa0 If we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the wall up, and if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they\xe2\x80\x99d be welcomed to the United States. One of the things we\xe2\x80\x99d save tremendous \xe2\x80\x94 just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.\xc2\xa0 If we had a wall, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need the military because we\xe2\x80\x99d have a wall. So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be signing a national emergency.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been signed many times before.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.\xc2\xa0 It gave the Presidents the power. There\xe2\x80\x99s rarely been a problem.\xc2\xa0 They sign it; nobody cares.\xc2\xa0 I guess they weren\xe2\x80\x99t very exciting.\xc2\xa0 But nobody cares.\xc2\xa0 They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs. We have some of the greatest people I know.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been with me from the beginning of my campaign \xe2\x80\x94 almost from the first week.\xc2\xa0 The Angel Moms.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms.\xc2\xa0 One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about killed, in the year of \xe2\x80\x9918.\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen you before.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 She said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m new.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s too bad.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too bad.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s so sad. Stand up, just for a second.\xc2\xa0 Show how beautiful your girl was.\xc2\xa0 Thank you. I have such respect for these people.\xc2\xa0 Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families.\xc2\xa0 I have great respect for these people.\xc2\xa0 These are great people.\xc2\xa0 These are great people.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country. And the press doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover them; they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, incredibly.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re not treated the way they should be.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for other people because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want what happened to their children or husband or anybody. We have one young lady whose husband \xe2\x80\x94 please, stand up.\xc2\xa0 Your husband was just killed in Maryland.\xc2\xa0 Incredible man.\xc2\xa0 Just killed.\xc2\xa0 Beautiful children \xe2\x80\x94 won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing their father again. These are brave people.\xc2\xa0 These are people that \xe2\x80\x94 they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be here.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be doing this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re doing it for other people.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?\xc2\xa0 I really do.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank you.\xc2\xa0 Incredible people. Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least \xe2\x80\x94 I think the number is ridiculously low \xe2\x80\x94 by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit \xe2\x80\x94 before I even started talking about the trade \xe2\x80\x94 it was a trade meeting.\xc2\xa0 It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important. I said, \xe2\x80\x9cListen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country.\xc2\xa0 It kills tens of thousands of people \xe2\x80\x94 I think far more than anybody registers.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.\xc2\xa0 Their criminal list \xe2\x80\x94 a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.\xc2\xa0 Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, \xe2\x80\x9cHow about a fine?\xe2\x80\x9d And when I asked President Xi, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you have a drug problem?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou have 1.4 billion people.\xc2\xa0 What do you mean you have no drug problem?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a drug problem.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDeath penalty.\xc2\xa0 We give death penalty to people that sell drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 End of problem. What do we do?\xc2\xa0 We set up blue ribbon committees.\xc2\xa0 Lovely men and women \xe2\x80\x94 they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time.\xc2\xa0 So if we want to get smart, we can get smart.\xc2\xa0 You can end the drug problem.\xc2\xa0 You can end it a lot faster than you think. But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a criminal penalty.\xc2\xa0 And the penalty is death.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99m most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth.\xc2\xa0 I think maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s no more important point. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope.\xc2\xa0 Their market is down close to 40 percent.\xc2\xa0 Our market is way up.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth.\xc2\xa0 Trillions.\xc2\xa0 Many trillions.\xc2\xa0 And China has lost trillions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens. China is coming here next week, by the way.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re coming home, the traders.\xc2\xa0 And then China is coming here next week.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe \xe2\x80\x94 for some remaining deals.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves. So, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable. And by signing the national emergency \xe2\x80\x94 something signed many times by other Presidents \xe2\x80\x94 many, many times.\xc2\xa0 President Obama \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels.\xc2\xa0 Criminal cartels.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good emergency that he signed.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.\xc2\xa0 So that would be a second national emergency.\xc2\xa0 But, in that case, it\xe2\x80\x99s already in place. And what we want \xe2\x80\x94 really want to do \xe2\x80\x94 is simple.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.\xc2\xa0 We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.\xc2\xa0 Nobody has done the job that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, nobody has done the job that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done on the border. And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy \xe2\x80\x94 and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes.\xc2\xa0 You know, I hear a lot of people say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, well.\xc2\xa0 But maybe the previous administration\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast.\xc2\xa0 We would have been down the tubes.\xc2\xa0 The regulations were strangling our country.\xc2\xa0 Unnecessary regulations. By creating such a strong economy \xe2\x80\x94 you just look at your televisions or see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on today; it\xe2\x80\x99s through the roof.\xc2\xa0 What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had before.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done an incredible job in stopping them, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a massive number of people. If we had the wall, it would be very easy.\xc2\xa0 We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row.\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need all of this incredible talent.\xc2\xa0 We would get \xe2\x80\x94 we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol.\xc2\xa0 You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things.\xc2\xa0 Law enforcement and Border Patrol. And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE.\xc2\xa0 ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be taking care of ICE.\xc2\xa0 You know, we talk about the new bill.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be taking care of ICE.\xc2\xa0 They wanted to get rid of ICE.\xc2\xa0 And the bill is just the opposite of that.\xc2\xa0 A lot of good things happened. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s the story.\xc2\xa0 We want to have a safe country.\xc2\xa0 I ran on a very simple slogan: \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a fantastic job, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been given the equipment.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t been given the walls.\xc2\xa0 And in the bill, by the way, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t even fight us on most of the stuff.\xc2\xa0 Ports of entry.\xc2\xa0 We have so much money, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with all the money they\xe2\x80\x99re giving us.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. The only place they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give as much money \xe2\x80\x94 $1,375,000,000.\xc2\xa0 Sounds like a lot, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much, although we\xe2\x80\x99re putting it to much better use than it used to be.\xc2\xa0 A lot of the past administrations, they had \xe2\x80\x94 it was easy to get, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t build or they didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what they could have done.\xc2\xa0 It would have been great.\xc2\xa0 It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession. And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.\xc2\xa0 People that should have stepped up did not step up.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t step up, and they should have.\xc2\xa0 Would have been easy.\xc2\xa0 Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier.\xc2\xa0 But some people didn\xe2\x80\x99t step up.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re stepping up now. So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to build a lot of wall.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re getting it done.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.\xc2\xa0 And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where a lot of the money has been spent \xe2\x80\x94 on renovation.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.\xc2\xa0 So \xe2\x80\x94 and we need new wall. So I want to thank everybody for being here.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 We have great respect for you.\xc2\xa0 The real country, our real country \xe2\x80\x94 the people that really love our country, they love you.\xc2\xa0 So I just want you to know that.\xc2\xa0 I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you\xe2\x80\x99re having. I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.\xc2\xa0 Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re giving you a lot of surplus.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn\xe2\x80\x99t like giving, previous to this administration.\xc2\xa0 But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.\xc2\xa0 And as we get it, as you know, we send it down.\xc2\xa0 And you have much better protection.\xc2\xa0 But I really appreciate you being here. So the order is signed.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there.\xc2\xa0 And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get another bad ruling.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a fair shake.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban.\xc2\xa0 They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won. And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban.\xc2\xa0 Because we have a ban.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very helpful.\xc2\xa0 Madam Secretary, is that right?\xc2\xa0 Without the ban, we\xe2\x80\x99d have a bigger problem.\xc2\xa0 We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the world.\xc2\xa0 And we won. But somebody said, \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Trump lost on the ban.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court.\xc2\xa0 He \xe2\x80\x94 he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go that far.\xc2\xa0 They were saying how I lost.\xc2\xa0 The person sitting right up here \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cDonald Trump lost on the ban.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yeah, I did.\xc2\xa0 And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too.\xc2\xa0 And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to take it that far.\xc2\xa0 But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too. The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we\xe2\x80\x99re declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters.\xc2\xa0 Thousands.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re out of this country.\xc2\xa0 We take them out by the thousands.\xc2\xa0 And they are monsters. Okay.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any questions?\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 John, go ahead. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President \xe2\x80\x94 (inaudible). AIDE:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we do.\xc2\xa0 There you go. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were prepared.\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, a lot of the money \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Were you saying I was prepared? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the microphone and prepared for questions. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared.\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe you said that. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughs.)\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 People don\xe2\x80\x99t like saying that. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were prepared for questions. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I am prepared.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m always prepared. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that\xe2\x80\x99s being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.\xc2\xa0 How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military.\xc2\xa0 Some of them haven\xe2\x80\x99t been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important.\xc2\xa0 I was speaking to a couple of them.\xc2\xa0 They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you going to use it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into details, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound too important to me. Plus, if you think, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re rebuilding our military, but we have a lot.\xc2\xa0 And under the previous administration, our military was depleted \xe2\x80\x94 badly depleted.\xc2\xa0 And they weren\xe2\x80\x99t spending \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, they had a much less \xe2\x80\x94 they had a much smaller amount of money. So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion \xe2\x80\x94 and this year, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be pretty big too, because there\xe2\x80\x99s few things more important than our military.\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military.\xc2\xa0 It was very badly depleted.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment.\xc2\xa0 We have \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have a military like we\xe2\x80\x99ve never had before. But when you think about the kind of numbers you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about \xe2\x80\x94 so you have $700 billion, $716 billion \xe2\x80\x94 when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall \xe2\x80\x94 which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of it, too. We\xe2\x80\x99re taking a lot of money from that realm also.\xc2\xa0 But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for. Yeah, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 ABC.\xc2\xa0 Not NBC.\xc2\xa0 I like ABC a little bit more \xe2\x80\x94 not much.\xc2\xa0 Come on, ABC.\xc2\xa0 Not much.\xc2\xa0 Pretty close. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?\xc2\xa0 Marco Rubio has made this point. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, not too many people.\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 Not too many people have said that.\xc2\xa0 But the courts will determine that. Look, I expect to be sued.\xc2\xa0 I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sued.\xc2\xa0 Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.\xc2\xa0 And then other people say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an invasion.\xc2\xa0 We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to stop.\xc2\xa0 With a wall, it would be very easy. So I think that we will be very successful in court.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear.\xc2\xa0 And the people that say we create precedent \xe2\x80\x94 well, what do you have?\xc2\xa0 Fifty-six?\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of times \xe2\x80\x94 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s creating precedent.\xc2\xa0 And many of those are far less important than having a border.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a border, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a country. You know, we fight \xe2\x80\x94 before I got here \xe2\x80\x94 we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t create a border for our own country. So I think what will happen is, sadly, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sued, and sadly, it\xe2\x80\x99ll go through a process.\xc2\xa0 And, happily, we\xe2\x80\x99ll win \xe2\x80\x94 I think. Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear it, NBC.\xc2\xa0 Come on. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I just want to say, in the past, when President Obama tried to use executive action as it related to immigration, you said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole concept of executive order, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way the country is supposed to be run.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to go through Congress and make a deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Will you concede that you were unable to make the deal that you had promised in the past, and that the deal you\xe2\x80\x99re ending up with now from Congress is less than what you could have had before a 35-day shutdown? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, I went through Congress.\xc2\xa0 I made a deal.\xc2\xa0 I got almost $1.4 billion when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to get one dollar \xe2\x80\x94 not one dollar.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get one dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, I got $1.4 billion.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy with it.\xc2\xa0 I also got billions and billions of dollars for other things \xe2\x80\x94 port of entries, lots of different things.\xc2\xa0 The purchase of drug equipment.\xc2\xa0 More than we were even requesting. In fact, the primary fight was on the wall.\xc2\xa0 Everything else, we have so much, as I said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do with it we have so much money.\xc2\xa0 But on the wall, they skimped. So I did \xe2\x80\x94 I was successful, in that sense, but I want to do it faster.\xc2\xa0 I could do the wall over a longer period of time.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to do this.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d rather do it much faster.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do it for the election.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve already done a lot of wall, for the election \xe2\x80\x94 2020.\xc2\xa0 And the only reason we\xe2\x80\x99re up here talking about this is because of the election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to do.\xc2\xa0 And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense. And I think that I just want to get it done faster, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. Okay.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, go ahead. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Thank you. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roberta Rampton from Reuters.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about China.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that enough progress has been made in the talks to head off the increase in tariffs scheduled for March 1? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China.\xc2\xa0 And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel \xe2\x80\x94 much of it comes from China \xe2\x80\x94 at 25 percent.\xc2\xa0 Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they\xe2\x80\x99re building plants all over the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful thing.\xc2\xa0 And from a defensive standpoint, and from any standpoint, you need steel. You know, you can do without certain industries.\xc2\xa0 Our country cannot do without steel. So, I love tariffs, but I also love them to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 And right now, China is paying us billions of dollars a year in tariffs.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even started. Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: If we make a deal, they won\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay.\xc2\xa0 You know, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a whole different story.\xc2\xa0 They won\xe2\x80\x99t be paying that, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a fair deal.\xc2\xa0 There won\xe2\x80\x99t be intellectual property theft.\xc2\xa0 There won\xe2\x80\x99t be so many other things that have gone on.\xc2\xa0 And no other President has done this.\xc2\xa0 No other \xe2\x80\x94 you know, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a deal with China.\xc2\xa0 You had the WTO, one of the worst trade deals ever made \xe2\x80\x94 probably even worse than NAFTA, if that\xe2\x80\x99s believable, which, you know, hard to believe, because I think NAFTA was just a disaster.\xc2\xa0 It was a total disaster for our country. And now we made the USMCA, which is going to be a terrific \xe2\x80\x94 a great deal.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, the USMCA, from Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s United States, Mexico, Canada \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s where the money is coming from, not directly but indirectly, for the wall.\xc2\xa0 And nobody wants to talk about that.\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99re saving billions and billions of dollars a year, if Congress approves that deal. Now, they might now want to approve a deal just because they\xe2\x80\x99ll say \xe2\x80\x94 one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of doing \xe2\x80\x94 this has never been done before: No matter how good a deal I make with China, if they sell me Beijing for one dollar, if they give me 50 percent of their land and every ship that they\xe2\x80\x99ve built over the last two years \xe2\x80\x94 which is a lot \xe2\x80\x94 and they give them to me free, the Democrats will say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lousy deal; that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible deal.\xe2\x80\x9d Like, ZTE, I got a billion \xe2\x80\x94 more than a billion-dollar penalty in a short period of time.\xc2\xa0 And the Democrats said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, should\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten more.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 When I made that deal, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I just got \xe2\x80\x94 I got over a billion-dollar penalty, plus they had to change their board of directors.\xc2\xa0 They had to change their top management.\xc2\xa0 But they had to pay over a billion dollars.\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It took like a week.\xc2\xa0 And the Democrats didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know there was a problem with ZTE. I\xe2\x80\x99m the one that find them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m the one that settled it.\xc2\xa0 Over a billion dollars.\xc2\xa0 And President Xi called me and he said it would be important to him if they could get a deal.\xc2\xa0 And we made a deal \xe2\x80\x94 paid \xe2\x80\x94 like, in a short period of time. The Democrats went out and said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, they should\xe2\x80\x99ve done better.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of doing is getting Chuck Schumer, getting Nancy Pelosi, having them bring two or three of their brilliant representatives.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll all go down together, and what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do is we\xe2\x80\x99ll negotiate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll put them in the room and let them speak up.\xc2\xa0 Because any deal I make with China, if it\xe2\x80\x99s the great \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be better than any deal that anybody ever dreamt possible, or I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have a deal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple. But any deal I make with China, Schumer is going to stand up and say, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it should\xe2\x80\x99ve been better.\xc2\xa0 It should\xe2\x80\x99ve been better.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And you know what?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable to me.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about doing something very different.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been \xe2\x80\x94 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be second-guessed.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not even second-guess; that\xe2\x80\x99s called politics.\xc2\xa0 Sadly, I\xe2\x80\x99d probably do the same thing to them, okay? But any deal I make toward the end, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to bring Schumer \xe2\x80\x94 at least offer him \xe2\x80\x94 and Pelosi.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease join me on the deal.\xe2\x80\x9d And, by the way, I just see our new Attorney General is sitting in the front row.\xc2\xa0 Please stand up, Bill.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.) \xc2\xa0Such an easy job he\xe2\x80\x99s got.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got the easiest job in government.\xc2\xa0 Thank you and congratulations.\xc2\xa0 That was a great vote yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yes, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In your remarks, sir, you said that you were too new to politics, earlier in your administration, when you would\xe2\x80\x99ve preferred that this be done.\xc2\xa0 Is that an admission of how you might be changing on the job?\xc2\xa0 And \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m learning.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I am learning.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99ve done this for \xe2\x80\x94 a senator came into my office and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been running for office for 30 years.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve won seven out of seven.\xc2\xa0 I did lose a couple when I was younger.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve won one out of one.\xc2\xa0 But, you know, I never did politics before.\xc2\xa0 Now I do politics.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I will tell you, I\xe2\x80\x99m very disappointed at certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you referring to Speaker Ryan, sir? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned \xe2\x80\x94 who? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Ryan. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not talk about it. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 What difference does it make?\xc2\xa0 But they should have pushed it faster.\xc2\xa0 They should have pushed it harder.\xc2\xa0 And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t. If they would have, it would have been a little bit better.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, I\xe2\x80\x99ve built a lot of wall.\xc2\xa0 I have a lot of money, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve built a lot of wall.\xc2\xa0 But it would\xe2\x80\x99ve been nice to have gotten done.\xc2\xa0 And I would like to see major immigration reform, and maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s something we can all work on, Bill, where we all get together and do major immigration reform \xe2\x80\x94 not just for a wall, for a barrier; for port of entry, for other things. We have a real problem.\xc2\xa0 We have catch-and-release.\xc2\xa0 You catch a criminal and you have to release them.\xc2\xa0 We have so many other things.\xc2\xa0 You have chain migration, where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members \xe2\x80\x94 because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re all in. You know what happened on the West Side Highway.\xc2\xa0 That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured \xe2\x80\x94 nobody talks about that \xe2\x80\x94 horribly \xe2\x80\x94 like, loss of legs and arms \xe2\x80\x94 going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.\xc2\xa0 He had many people brought in because he was in the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s called chain migration. And then you have the lottery.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they\xe2\x80\x99re not putting you in; they\xe2\x80\x99re putting some very bad people in the lottery.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s common sense.\xc2\xa0 If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put in my stars; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put in people I don\xe2\x80\x99t want.\xc2\xa0 The lottery system is a disaster.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m stuck with it. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, could you tell us \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 It should have \xe2\x80\x94 wait.\xc2\xa0 It should have never happened.\xc2\xa0 Okay. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, could you tell us to what degree some of the outside conservative voices helped to shape your views on this national emergency? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I would talk about it.\xc2\xa0 Look, Sean Hannity has been a terrific, terrific supporter of what I do.\xc2\xa0 Not of me.\xc2\xa0 If I changed my views, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be with me. Rush Limbaugh \xe2\x80\x94 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a great guy.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s a guy who can speak for three hours without a phone call.\xc2\xa0 Try doing that sometime.\xc2\xa0 For three hours, he speaks.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this guy is unbelievable.\xc2\xa0 Try speaking for three hours without taking calls.\xc2\xa0 Taking calls is easy.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer this one.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer that one.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He goes for three hours, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got an audience that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should they be \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Wait \xe2\x80\x94 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should they be deciding policy, sir? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t decide policy.\xc2\xa0 In fact, if I went opposite \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, they have somebody \xe2\x80\x94 Ann Coulter.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know her.\xc2\xa0 I hardly know her.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to her in way over a year.\xc2\xa0 But the press loves saying \xe2\x80\x9cAnn Coulter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Probably, if I did speak to her, she\xe2\x80\x99d be very nice.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to speak to her.\xc2\xa0 I would speak to her; I have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason: When they asked her, like right at the beginning, who was going to win the election, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cDonald Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And the two people that asked her that question smiled.\xc2\xa0 They said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re kidding, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cNope.\xc2\xa0 Donald Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d So I like her, but she\xe2\x80\x99s off the reservation.\xc2\xa0 But anybody that knows her understands that.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to her.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow her.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to her.\xc2\xa0 But the press loves to bring up the name \xe2\x80\x9cAnn Coulter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And you know what?\xc2\xa0 I think she\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 I think she\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to her. Laura has been great.\xc2\xa0 Laura Ingraham.\xc2\xa0 Tucker Carlson has been great.\xc2\xa0 I actually have a couple people on CNN that have been very good.\xc2\xa0 I have some on MSNBC.\xc2\xa0 The other day, they did a great report of me.\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the hell did that come from?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think it was the only one in over a year. So the crazy thing is, I just had, as you know, Rasmussen \xe2\x80\x94 52 percent in the polls.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my highest poll number.\xc2\xa0 And people get what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 They get it.\xc2\xa0 They really get it.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m honored by it. Yes.\xc2\xa0 Jim Acosta. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could comment on this disconnect that we seem to have in this country, where you are presenting information about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening at the border \xe2\x80\x94 calling it an \xe2\x80\x9cinvasion,\xe2\x80\x9d talking about women with duct tape over their mouths, and so on \xe2\x80\x94 and yet there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of reporting out there, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of crime data out there, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Department of Homeland Security data out there that shows border crossings at a near-record low \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s because of us.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s still \xe2\x80\x94 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 that shows undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Excuse me.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still massive numbers of crossings. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 that shows undocumented criminals \xe2\x80\x94 or undocumented immigrants committing crime at lower levels than native-born Americans.\xc2\xa0 What do you say \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t really believe that stat, do you?\xc2\xa0 Do you really believe that stat? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you \xe2\x80\x94 well, let me ask you this \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Take a look at our federal prisons. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe in facts and statistics and data, but \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 Any more?\xc2\xa0 Quick, let\xe2\x80\x99s go. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask you this: What do you say to your critics who say that you are creating a national emergency, that you\xe2\x80\x99re concocting a national emergency here in order to get your wall because you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it through other ways? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I ask the Angel Moms: What do you think?\xc2\xa0 Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m creating something? Ask these incredible women, who lost their daughters and their sons.\xc2\xa0 Okay? PARTICIPANT:\xc2\xa0 This is real. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Because your question is a very political question because you have an agenda.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re CNN.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re fake news.\xc2\xa0 You have an agenda. \xc2\xa0The numbers that you gave are wrong. Take a look at our federal prison population.\xc2\xa0 See how many of them, percentage-wise, are illegal aliens.\xc2\xa0 Just see.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead and see.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fake question. Yes.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a follow-up? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, unifying crime reporting statistics \xe2\x80\x94 numbers from your own Border Patrol, numbers from this government \xe2\x80\x94 show that the amount of illegal immigrants are down, there is not violence on the border, and that most \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not violence on the border? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not as much violence as \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Oh, really? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me \xe2\x80\x94 wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Wait \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You had 26 people killed \xe2\x80\x94 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me finish the question, please.\xc2\xa0 Let me finish the question, please. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Two weeks ago, 26 people were killed in a gunfight on the border \xe2\x80\x94 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x94 I understand what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 a mile away from where I went. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was there.\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the question.\xc2\xa0 The question is \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Do we forget about that? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not forgetting about it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to clarify where you get your numbers, because most of the DEA crime reporting statistics that we see show that drugs are coming across at the ports of entry, that illegal immigration is down, and the violence is down. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Okay. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what do you base your facts on? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Okay, let me \xe2\x80\x94 come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go.\xc2\xa0 Sort of \xe2\x80\x94 sort of \xe2\x80\x94 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, secondly \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 You get one.\xc2\xa0 You get one.\xc2\xa0 Ready? Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the second question is \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Just sit down.\xc2\xa0 Wait.\xc2\xa0 Sit down.\xc2\xa0 Sit down. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you please answer it? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Sit down.\xc2\xa0 You get one question. I get my numbers from a lot of sources \xe2\x80\x94 like Homeland Security, primarily.\xc2\xa0 And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster.\xc2\xa0 And you know what else is a disaster?\xc2\xa0 The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.\xc2\xa0 Billions and billions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So your own government stats are wrong, are you saying? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 I use many stats.\xc2\xa0 I use many stats. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you share those stats with us? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Let me tell you, you have stats that are far worse than the ones that I use.\xc2\xa0 But I use many stats, but I also use Homeland Security. All right, next question. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you \xe2\x80\x94 wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Go.\xc2\xa0 Please. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 I just want to bring you back to China for a second.\xc2\xa0 The White House put out a statement today talking about the March 1st deadline.\xc2\xa0 The other day, though, you gave the possibility that maybe this could slide.\xc2\xa0 Are you eyeing a possible extension \xe2\x80\x94 30 days, maybe 60 days?\xc2\xa0 What is the status there?\xc2\xa0 Or is March 1st the deadline? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 Very good question.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a very big deal.\xc2\xa0 I guess you could say it\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x94 must be the biggest deal ever made, if you think.\xc2\xa0 Trade with China, how big does that get?\xc2\xa0 Although if you look, the USCMA is right up there.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s very complicated.\xc2\xa0 There are many, many points that we\xe2\x80\x99re bringing up that nobody ever brought up or thought to bring up, but they\xe2\x80\x99re very important, because we were on the wrong side of every one of them. There is a possibility that I will extend the date.\xc2\xa0 And if I do that, if I see that we\xe2\x80\x99re close to a deal or the deal is going in the right direction, I would do that at the same tariffs that we\xe2\x80\x99re charging now.\xc2\xa0 I would not increase the tariffs. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also ask you about the debt, sir, because it\xe2\x80\x99s gone from a shade under $20 trillion from when you took office.\xc2\xa0 Now it\xe2\x80\x99s a shade over $22 trillion and heading in the wrong direction.\xc2\xa0 What are your plans to reverse it? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about growth.\xc2\xa0 But before I \xe2\x80\x94 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 really focus on that \xe2\x80\x94 and you have to remember, President Obama put on more debt on this country than every President in the history of our country combined.\xc2\xa0 So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined.\xc2\xa0 Combine them all.\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t be talking about that.\xc2\xa0 But I talk about it because I consider it very important. But first, I have to straighten out the military.\xc2\xa0 The military was depleted.\xc2\xa0 And if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong military \xe2\x80\x94 that hopefully we won\xe2\x80\x99t have to use because it\xe2\x80\x99s strong \xe2\x80\x94 if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong military, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about debt; you have bigger problems.\xc2\xa0 So I have to straighten out the military.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I did the $700- and $716 billion.\xc2\xa0 But growth will straighten it out. You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.\xc2\xa0 Everybody said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening is growth.\xc2\xa0 But before I can focus too much on that, a very big expense is military.\xc2\xa0 And we have no choice but to straighten out our military. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is growth the only answer, sir, or is (inaudible)? THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, go ahead. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea \xe2\x80\x94 back on the last summit, you guys came out with a pretty general agreement. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yes. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was wondering what you thought has, you know, been accomplished since the last summit.\xc2\xa0 And then \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 A lot. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 are we going to be seeing anything concrete \xe2\x80\x94 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 A lot has been accomplished.\xc2\xa0 Okay. Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x94 on denuclearization. THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Yeah.\xc2\xa0 A lot has been accomplished.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with them, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to them. When I came into office, I met right there, in the Oval Office, with President Obama.\xc2\xa0 And I sat in those beautiful chairs and we talked.\xc2\xa0 It was supposed to be 15 minutes.\xc2\xa0 As you know, it ended up being many times longer than that. And I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest problem?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cBy far, North Korea.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for him, but I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea.\xc2\xa0 I think he was ready to go to war.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And where are we now?\xc2\xa0 No missiles.\xc2\xa0 No rockets.\xc2\xa0 No nuclear testing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot. But much more importantly than all of it \xe2\x80\x94 much more important \xe2\x80\x94 much, much more important that that is we have a great relationship.\xc2\xa0 I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a job.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think I can say this: Prime Minister Abe of Japan gave me the most beautiful copy of a letter that he sent to the people who give out a thing called the Nobel Prize.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI have nominated you\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cRespectfully, on behalf of Japan, I am asking them to give you the Nobel Peace Prize.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Many other people feel that way too.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably never get it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. They gave it to Obama.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know what he got it for.\xc2\xa0 He was there for about 15 seconds and he got the Nobel Prize.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, what did I get it for?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 With me, I probably will never get it. But if you look at Idlib Province in Syria, I stopped the slaughter of perhaps 3 million people.\xc2\xa0 Nobody talk about that.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that.\xc2\xa0 Russia and Iran and Syria were going to go in and perhaps destroy 3 million people in order to get 45,000 terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And I heard about it from a woman who had her parents and her brothers living there, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I thought \xe2\x80\x94 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 What are you talking about?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cNo, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I come home, and I read a certain paper where the story was there that they were actually forming to go into \xe2\x80\x94 to really \xe2\x80\x94 to really do big destruction.\xc2\xa0 And I put out a statement that \xe2\x80\x9cyou better not do it.\xe2\x80\x9d And in all fairness to Russia and Iran and Syria, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t attack.\xc2\xa0 Or they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it surgically, at least.\xc2\xa0 Saved a lot of people.\xc2\xa0 We do a lot of good work.\xc2\xa0 This administration does a tremendous job, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t get credit for it.\xc2\xa0 But I think the people understand what we do. So Prime Minister Abe gave me \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most beautiful five letter \xe2\x80\x94 five-page letter.\xc2\xa0 Nobel Prize.\xc2\xa0 He sent it to them.\xc2\xa0 You know why?\xc2\xa0 Because he had rocket ships and he had missiles flying over Japan.\xc2\xa0 And they had alarms going off; you know that.\xc2\xa0 Now, all of a sudden, they feel good; they feel safe.\xc2\xa0 I did that. And it was a very tough dialogue at the beginning.\xc2\xa0 Fire and fury.\xc2\xa0 Total annihilation.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cMy button is bigger than yours\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmy button works.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Remember that?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that.\xc2\xa0 And people said, \xe2\x80\x9cTrump is crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And you know what it ended up being?\xc2\xa0 A very good relationship.\xc2\xa0 I like him a lot and he likes me a lot.\xc2\xa0 Nobody else would have done that. The Obama administration couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it.\xc2\xa0 Number one, they probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done it.\xc2\xa0 And number two, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the capability to do it. So I just want to thank everybody.\xc2\xa0 I want to wish our Attorney General great luck and speed, and enjoy your life.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Bill, good luck.\xc2\xa0 A tremendous reputation.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ll do a great job.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 And thank you, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.'
