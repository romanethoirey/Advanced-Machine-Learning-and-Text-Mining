b'Good evening, my fellow Americans:\n\r\nTonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many people in all parts of the world\xe2\x80\x94the war in Vietnam.\n\r\nI believe that one of the reasons for the deep division about Vietnam is that many Americans have lost confidence in what their Government has told them about our policy. The American people cannot and should not be asked to support a policy which involves the overriding issues of war and peace unless they know the truth about that policy.\n\r\nTonight, therefore, I would like to answer some of the questions that I know are on the minds of many of you listening to me.\n\r\nHow and why did America get involved in Vietnam in the first place?\n\r\nHow has this administration changed the policy of the previous administration?\n\r\nWhat has really happened in the negotiations in Paris and on the battlefront in Vietnam?\n\r\nWhat choices do we have if we are to end the war?\n\r\nWhat are the prospects for peace? Now, let me begin by describing the situation I found when I was inaugurated on January 20.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The war had been going on for 4 years.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9431,000 Americans had been killed in action.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The training program for the South Vietnamese was behind schedule.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94540,000 Americans were in Vietnam with no plans to reduce the number.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No progress had been made at the negotiations in Paris and the United States had not put forth a comprehensive peace proposal.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The war was causing deep division at home and criticism from many of our friends as well as our enemies abroad.\n\r\nIn view of these circumstances there were some who urged that I end the war at once by ordering the immediate withdrawal of all American forces.\n\r\nFrom a political standpoint this would have been a popular and easy course to follow. After all, we became involved in the war while my predecessor was in office. I could blame the defeat which would be the result of my action on him and come out as the peacemaker. Some put it to me quite bluntly: This was the only way to avoid allowing Johnson\'s war to become Nixon\'s war.\n\r\nBut I had a greater obligation than to think only of the years of my administration and of the next election. I had to think of the effect of my decision on the next generation and on the future of peace and freedom in America and in the world.\n\r\nLet us all understand that the question before us is not whether some Americans are for peace and some Americans are against peace. The question at issue is not whether Johnson\'s war becomes Nixon\'s war.\n\r\nThe great question is: How can we win America\'s peace?\n\r\nWell, let us turn now to the fundamental issue. Why and how did the United States become involved in Vietnam in the first place?\n\r\nFifteen years ago North Vietnam, with the logistical support of Communist China and the Soviet Union, launched a campaign to impose a Communist government on South Vietnam by instigating and supporting a revolution.\n\r\nIn response to the request of the Government of South Vietnam, President Eisenhower sent economic aid and military equipment to assist the people of South Vietnam in their efforts to prevent a Communist takeover. Seven years ago, President Kennedy sent 16,000 military personnel to Vietnam as combat advisers. Four years ago, President Johnson sent American combat forces to South Vietnam.\n\r\nNow, many believe that President Johnson\'s decision to send American combat forces to South Vietnam was wrong. And many others\xe2\x80\x94I among them\xe2\x80\x94have been strongly critical of the way the war has been conducted.\n\r\nBut the question facing us today is: Now that we are in the war, what is the best way to end it?\n\r\nIn January I could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam would be a disaster not only for South Vietnam but for the United States and for the cause of peace.\n\r\nFor the South Vietnamese, our precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the Communists to repeat the massacres which followed their takeover in the North 15 years before.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They then murdered more than 50,000 people and hundreds of thousands more died in slave labor camps.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We saw a prelude of what would happen in South Vietnam when the Communists entered the city of Hue last year. During their brief rule there, there was a bloody reign of terror in which 3,000 civilians were clubbed, shot to death, and buried in mass graves.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With the sudden collapse of our support, these atrocities of Hue would become the nightmare of the entire nation\xe2\x80\x94and particularly for the million and a half Catholic refugees who fled to South Vietnam when the\n\r\nCommunists took over in the North. For the United States, this first defeat in our Nation\'s history would result in a collapse of confidence in American leadership, not only in Asia but throughout the world.\n\r\nThree American Presidents have recognized the great stakes involved in Vietnam and understood what had to be done.\n\r\nIn 1963, President Kennedy, with his characteristic eloquence and clarity, said: "we want to see a stable government there, carrying on a struggle to maintain its national independence."\n\r\n"We believe strongly in that. We are not going to withdraw from that effort. In my opinion, for us to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of South Viet-Nam, but Southeast Asia. So we are going to stay there."\n\r\nPresident Eisenhower and President Johnson expressed the same conclusion during their terms of office.\n\r\nFor the future of peace, precipitate withdrawal would thus be a disaster of immense magnitude.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A nation cannot remain great if it betrays its allies and lets down its friends.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our defeat and humiliation in South Vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the councils of those great powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of world conquest.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This would spark violence wherever our commitments help maintain the peace\xe2\x80\x94in the Middle East, in Berlin, eventually even in the Western Hemisphere.\n\r\nUltimately, this would cost more lives. It would not bring peace; it would bring more war.\n\r\nFor these reasons, I rejected the recommendation that I should end the war by immediately withdrawing all of our forces. I chose instead to change American policy on both the negotiating front and battlefront.\n\r\nIn order to end a war fought on many fronts, I initiated a pursuit for peace on many fronts.\n\r\nIn a television speech on May 14, in a speech before the United Nations, and on a number of other occasions I set forth our peace proposals in great detail.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We have offered the complete withdrawal of all outside forces within one year.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We have proposed a cease-fire under international supervision.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We have offered free elections under international supervision with the Communists participating in the organization and conduct of the elections as an organized political force. And the Saigon Government has pledged to accept the result of the elections.\n\r\nWe have not put forth our proposals on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. We have indicated that we are willing to discuss the proposals that have been put forth by the other side. We have declared that anything is negotiable except the fight of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own future. At the Paris peace conference, Ambassador Lodge has demonstrated our flexibility and good faith in 40 public meetings.\n\r\nHanoi has refused even to discuss our proposals. They demand our unconditional acceptance of their terms, which are that we withdraw all American forces immediately and unconditionally and that we overthrow the Government of South Vietnam as we leave.\n\r\nWe have not limited our peace initiatives to public forums and public statements. I recognized, in January, that a long and bitter war like this usually cannot be settled in a public forum. That is why in addition to the public statements and negotiations I have explored every possible private avenue that might lead to a settlement.\n\r\nTonight I am taking the unprecedented step of disclosing to you some of our other initiatives for peace\xe2\x80\x94initiatives we undertook privately and secretly because we thought we thereby might open a door which publicly would be closed.\n\r\nI did not wait for my inauguration to begin my quest for peace.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Soon after my election, through an individual who is directly in contact on a personal basis with the leaders of North Vietnam, I made two private offers for a rapid, comprehensive settlement. Hanoi\'s replies called in effect for our surrender before negotiations.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Since the Soviet Union furnishes most of the military equipment for North Vietnam, Secretary of State Rogers, my Assistant for National Security Affairs, Dr. Kissinger, Ambassador Lodge, and I, personally, have met on a number of occasions with representatives of the Soviet Government to enlist their assistance in getting meaningful negotiations started. In addition, we have had extended discussions directed toward that same end with representatives of other governments which have diplomatic relations with North Vietnam. None of these initiatives have to date produced results.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In mid-July, I became convinced that it was necessary to make a major move to break the deadlock in the Paris talks. I spoke directly in this office, where I am now sitting, with an individual who had known Ho Chi Minh [President, Democratic Republic of Vietnam] on a personal basis for 25 years. Through him I sent a letter to Ho Chi Minh. I did this outside of the usual diplomatic channels with the hope that with the necessity of making statements for propaganda removed, there might be constructive progress toward bringing the war to an end. Let me read from that letter to you now.\n\r\n"Dear Mr. President:\n\r\n"I realize that it is difficult to communicate meaningfully across the gulf of four years of war. But precisely because of this gulf, I wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm in all solemnity my desire to work for a just peace. I deeply believe that the war in Vietnam has gone on too long and delay in bringing it to an end can benefit no one--least of all the people of Vietnam ....\n\r\n"The time has come to move forward at the conference table toward an early resolution of this tragic war. You will find us forthcoming and open-minded in a common effort to bring the blessings of peace to the brave people of Vietnam. Let history record that at this critical juncture, both sides turned their face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war."\n\r\nI received Ho Chi Minh\'s reply on August 30, 3 days before his death. It simply reiterated the public position North Vietnam had taken at Paris and flatly rejected my initiative.\n\r\nThe full text of both letters is being released to the press.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In addition to the public meetings that I have referred to, Ambassador Lodge has met with Vietnam\'s chief negotiator in Paris in 11 private sessions.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We have taken other significant initiatives which must remain secret to keep open some channels of communication which may still prove to be productive. But the effect of all the public, private, and secret negotiations which have been undertaken since the bombing halt a year ago and since this administration came into office on January 20, can be summed up in one sentence: No progress whatever has been made except agreement on the shape of the bargaining table. Well now, who is at fault?\n\r\nIt has become clear that the obstacle in negotiating an end to the war is not the President of the United States. It is not the South Vietnamese Government.\n\r\nThe obstacle is the other side\'s absolute refusal to show the least willingness to join us in seeking a just peace. And it will not do so while it is convinced that all it has to do is to wait for our next concession, and our next concession after that one, until it gets everything it wants.\n\r\nThere can now be no longer any question that progress in negotiation depends only on Hanoi\'s deciding to negotiate, to negotiate seriously.\n\r\nI realize that this report on our efforts on the diplomatic front is discouraging to the American people, but the American people are entitled to know the truth-the bad news as well as the good news-where the lives of our young men are involved.\n\r\nNow let me turn, however, to a more encouraging report on another front.\n\r\nAt the time we launched our search for peace I recognized we might not succeed in bringing an end to the war through negotiation. I, therefore, put into effect another plan to bring peace\xe2\x80\x94a plan which will bring the war to an end regardless of what happens on the negotiating front.\n\r\nIt is in line with a major shift in U.S. foreign policy which I described in my press conference at Guam on July 25. Let me briefly explain what has been described as the Nixon Doctrine\xe2\x80\x94a policy which not only will help end the war in Vietnam, but which is an essential element of our program to prevent future Vietnams.\n\r\nWe Americans are a do-it-yourself people. We are an impatient people. Instead of teaching someone else to do a job, we like to do it ourselves. And this trait has been carried over into our foreign policy.\n\r\nIn Korea and again in Vietnam, the United States furnished most of the money, most of the arms, and most of the men to help the people of those countries defend their freedom against Communist aggression.\n\r\nBefore any American troops were committed to Vietnam, a leader of another Asian country expressed this opinion to me when I was traveling in Asia as a private citizen. He said: "When you are trying to assist another nation defend its freedom, U.S. policy should be to help them fight the war but not to fight the war for them."\n\r\nWell, in accordance with this wise counsel, I laid down in Guam three principles as guidelines for future American policy toward Asia:\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94First, the United States will keep all of its treaty commitments.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Third, in cases involving other types of aggression, we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments. But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense.\n\r\nAfter I announced this policy, I found that the leaders of the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, and other nations which might be threatened by Communist aggression, welcomed this new direction in American foreign policy.\n\r\nThe defense of freedom is everybody\'s business\xe2\x80\x94not just America\'s business. And it is particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom is threatened. In the previous administration, we Americanized the war in Vietnam. In this administration, we are Vietnamizing the search for peace.\n\r\nThe policy of the previous administration not only resulted in our assuming the primary responsibility for fighting the war, but even more significantly did not adequately stress the goal of strengthening the South Vietnamese so that they could defend themselves when we left.\n\r\nThe Vietnamization plan was launched following Secretary Laird\'s visit to Vietnam in March. Under the plan, I ordered first a substantial increase in the training and equipment of South Vietnamese forces.\n\r\nIn July, on my visit to Vietnam, I changed General Abrams\' orders so that they were consistent with the objectives of our new policies. Under the new orders, the primary mission of our troops is to enable the South Vietnamese forces to assume the full responsibility for the security of South Vietnam.\n\r\nOur air operations have been reduced by over 20 percent.\n\r\nAnd now we have begun to see the results of this long overdue change in American policy in Vietnam.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After 5 years of Americans going into Vietnam, we are finally bringing American men home. By December 15, over 60,000 men will have been withdrawn from South Vietnam including 20 percent of all of our combat forces.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The South Vietnamese have continued to gain in strength. As a result they have been able to take over combat responsibilities from our American troops.\n\r\nTwo other significant developments have occurred since this administration took office.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Enemy infiltration, infiltration which is essential if they are to launch a major attack, over the last 3 months is less than 20 percent of what it was over the same period last year.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Most important\xe2\x80\x94United States casualties have declined during the last 2 months to the lowest point in 3 years.\n\r\nLet me now turn to our program for the future.\n\r\nWe have adopted a plan which we have worked out in cooperation with the South Vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all U.S. combat ground forces, and their replacement by South Vietnamese forces on an orderly scheduled timetable. This withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness. As South Vietnamese forces become stronger, the rate of American withdrawal can become greater.\n\r\nI have not and do not intend to announce the timetable for our program. And there are obvious reasons for this decision which I am sure you will understand. As I have indicated on several occasions, the rate of withdrawal will depend on developments on three fronts.\n\r\nOne of these is the progress which can be or might be made in the Paris talks. An announcement of a fixed timetable for our withdrawal would completely remove any incentive for the enemy to negotiate an agreement. They would simply wait until our forces had withdrawn and then move in.\n\r\nThe other two factors on which we will base our withdrawal decisions are the level of enemy activity and the progress of the training programs of the South Vietnamese forces. And I am glad to be able to report tonight progress on both of these fronts has been greater than we anticipated when we started the program in June for withdrawal. As a result, our timetable for withdrawal is more optimistic now than when we made our first estimates in June. Now, this clearly demonstrates why it is not wise to be frozen in on a fixed timetable.\n\r\nWe must retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on the situation as it is at that time rather than on estimates that are no longer valid.\n\r\nAlong with this optimistic estimate, I must\xe2\x80\x94in all candor\xe2\x80\x94leave one note of caution.\n\r\nIf the level of enemy activity significantly increases we might have to adjust our timetable accordingly.\n\r\nHowever, I want the record to be completely clear on one point.\n\r\nAt the time of the bombing halt just a year ago, there was some confusion as to whether there was an understanding on the part of the enemy that if we stopped the bombing of North Vietnam they would stop the shelling of cities in South Vietnam. I want to be sure that there is no misunderstanding on the part of the enemy with regard to our withdrawal program.\n\r\nWe have noted the reduced level of infiltration, the reduction of our casualties, and are basing our withdrawal decisions partially on those factors.\n\r\nIf the level of infiltration or our casualties increase while we are trying to scale down the fighting, it will be the result of a conscious decision by the enemy.\n\r\nHanoi could make no greater mistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to its advantage. If I conclude that increased enemy action jeopardizes our remaining forces in Vietnam, I shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation.\n\r\nThis is not a threat. This is a statement of policy, which as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces, I am making in meeting my responsibility for the protection of American fighting men wherever they may be.\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, I am sure you can recognize from what I have said that we really only have two choices open to us if we want to end this war.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I can order an immediate, precipitate withdrawal of all Americans from Vietnam without regard to the effects of that action.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or we can persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiated settlement if possible, or through continued implementation of our plan for Vietnamization if necessary\xe2\x80\x94a plan in which we will withdraw all of our forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program, as the South Vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom. I have chosen this second course. It is not the easy way. It is the right way.\n\r\nIt is a plan which will end the war and serve the cause of peace\xe2\x80\x94not just in Vietnam but in the Pacific and in the world.\n\r\nIn speaking of the consequences of a precipitate withdrawal, I mentioned that our allies would lose confidence in America.\n\r\nFar more dangerous, we would lose confidence in ourselves. Oh, the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that our men were coming home. But as we saw the consequences of what we had done, inevitable remorse and divisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people.\n\r\nWe have faced other crises in our history and have become stronger by rejecting the easy way out and taking the right way in meeting our challenges. Our greatness as a nation has been our capacity to do what had to be done when we knew our course was right.\n\r\nI recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan for peace I have chosen. Honest and patriotic Americans have reached different conclusions as to how peace should be achieved.\n\r\nIn San Francisco a few weeks ago, I saw demonstrators. carrying signs reading: "Lose in Vietnam, bring the boys home."\n\r\nWell, one of the strengths of our free society is that any American has a right to reach that conclusion and to advocate that point of view. But as President of the United States, I would be untrue to my oath of office if I allowed the policy of this Nation to be dictated by the minority who hold that point of view and who try to impose it on the Nation by mounting demonstrations in the street.\n\r\nFor almost 200 years, the policy of this Nation has been made under our Constitution by those leaders in the Congress and the White House elected by all of the people. If a vocal minority, however fervent its cause, prevails over reason and the will of the majority, this Nation has no future as a free society.\n\r\nAnd now I would like to address a word, if I may, to the young people of this Nation who are particularly concerned, and I understand why they are concerned, about this war.\n\r\nI respect your idealism.\n\r\nI share your concern for peace. I want peace as much as you do. There are powerful personal reasons I want to end this war. This week I will have to sign 83 letters to mothers, fathers, wives, and loved ones of men who have given their lives for America in Vietnam. It is very little satisfaction to me that this is only one-third as many letters as I signed the first week in office. There is nothing I want more than to see the day come when I do not have to write any of those letters.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I want to end the war to save the lives of those brave young men in Vietnam.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But I want to end it in a way which will increase the chance that their younger brothers and their sons will not have to fight in some future Vietnam someplace in the world.\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I want to end the war for another reason. I want to end it so that the energy and dedication of you, our young people, now too often directed into bitter hatred against those responsible for the war, can be turned to the great challenges of peace, a better life for all Americans, a better life for all people on this earth.\n\r\nI have chosen a plan for peace. I believe it will succeed.\n\r\nIf it does succeed, what the critics say now won\'t matter. If it does not succeed, anything I say then won\'t matter.\n\r\nI know it may not be fashionable to speak of patriotism or national destiny these days. But I feel it is appropriate to do so on this occasion\n\r\nTwo hundred years ago this Nation was weak and poor. But even then, America was the hope of millions in the world. Today we have become the strongest and richest nation in the world. And the Wheel of destiny has turned so that any hope the world has for the survival of peace and freedom will be determined by whether the American people have the moral stamina and the courage to meet the challenge of free world leadership.\n\r\nLet historians not record that when America was the most powerful nation in the world we passed on the other side of the road and allowed the last hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people to be suffocated by the forces of totalitarianism.\n\r\nAnd so tonight\xe2\x80\x94to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans\xe2\x80\x94I ask for your support.\n\r\nI pledged in my campaign for the Presidency to end the war in a way that we could win the peace. I have initiated a plan of action which will enable me to keep that pledge.\n\r\nThe more support I can have from the American people, the sooner that pledge can be redeemed; for the more divided we are at home, the less likely the enemy is to negotiate at Paris.\n\r\nLet us be united for peace. Let us also be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that.\n\r\nFifty years ago, in this room and at this very desk, President Woodrow Wilson spoke words which caught the imagination of a war-weary world. He said: "This is the war to end war." His dream for peace after World War I was shattered on the hard realities of great power politics and Woodrow Wilson died a broken man.\n\r\nTonight I do not tell you that the war in Vietnam is the war to end wars. But I do say this: I have initiated a plan which will end this war in a way that will bring us closer to that great goal to which Woodrow Wilson and every American President in our history has been dedicated\xe2\x80\x94the goal of a just and lasting peace.\n\r\nAs President I hold the responsibility for choosing the best path to that goal and then leading the Nation along it.\n\r\nI pledge to you tonight that I shall meet this responsibility with all of the strength and wisdom I can command in accordance with your hopes, mindful of your concerns, sustained by your prayers.\n\r\nThank you and goodnight.'
