b'Mr. Vice President, and Mr. Speaker, and Members of the Senate and House of Representatives:\r\nYesterday, December 7, 1941\xe2\x80\x94a date which will live in infamy\xe2\x80\x94the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\r\nThe United States was at peace with that Nation and, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conversation with its Government and its Emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. Indeed, one hour after Japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the American Island of Oahu, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and his colleague delivered to our Secretary of State a formal reply to a recent American message. And while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack.\r\nIt will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time the Japanese Government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace.\r\nThe attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. In addition American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu.\r\nYesterday the Japanese Government also launched an attack against Malaya.\r\nLast night Japanese forces attacked Hong Kong.\r\nLast night Japanese forces attacked Guam.\r\nLast night Japanese forces attacked the Philippine Islands.\r\nLast night the Japanese attacked Wake Island. And this morning the Japanese attacked Midway Island.\r\nJapan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the Pacific area. The facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves. The people of the United States have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our Nation.\r\nAs Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy I have directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\r\nBut always will our whole Nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.\r\nNo matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory. I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.\r\nHostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger.\r\nWith confidence in our armed forces\xe2\x80\x94with the unbounding determination of our people\xe2\x80\x94we will gain the inevitable triumph, so help us God.\r\nI ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire.'
